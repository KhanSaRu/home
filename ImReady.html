			[Intro]
			I'm ready...<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1: Jack Met & Ryan Met]<br>
			You're feeling good, you're feeling right<br>
			Across the floor, and I'm already losing my mind<br>
			Baby girl, looking fine<br>
			Watch you playing and playing and playing these guys<br>
			Catch my stare, little smile<br>
			Tell me that you're ready and you're feeling the vibe<br>
			Someday I'll be so damn sublime<br>
			We'll arrive behind a hashtag sign<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			I won't forget you, but I may<br>
			Forget your name<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: AJR]<br>
			My lady<br>

			[Intro]<br>
			Oh-oh-oh<br>
			Oh-oh-oh<br>
			Hey! Hey!<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Jack]<br>
			Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen<br>
			Finally, I'm right where I should be<br>
			Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot<br>
			You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops<br>
			You know<br>
			Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen<br>
			Oh-oh-oh<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1: Ryan]<br>
			Called you up so we could reminisce<br>
			About the old days, gold days, how we've been<br>
			The city's rusty after what we did<br>
			We did, we did, we did<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: All]<br>
			Hey, and though I know it's been a long time in the records<br>
			But I saw you smiling. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-woody-allen-lyrics">more</a>

			<p>
			[Verse 1: Ryan]<br>
			No point in dreaming if you’re alone<br>
			No point in walking without the road<br>
			No point in crying without that someone there beside you<br>
			Saying it will be okay<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: Ryan]<br>
			I'll take my time<br>
			I'll take my time<br>
			You cannot rush<br>
			What can’t be timed<br>
			And it's tough believing<br>
			There's someone living out there<br>
			Happier than me<br>
			Happier than me<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Jack]<br>
			We may be lost, and gone forever<br>
			The rain will wash our memory<br>
			But when we cry. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-growing-old-on-bleecker-street-lyrics">more</a>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Damn, now all the pretty teens and fake IDs around me<br>
			Where did they come from?<br>
			Oh we'll never look like all the models in the movies<br>
			We'll never know<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But tonight, call your friends down<br>
			We're on our way now<br>
			And I feel like shouting, oh, I feel like shouting<br>
			Oh, tonight, it don't matter who you're from<br>
			Tonight we're 21 under all these lights<br>
			(Hey)<br>
			I put my heart, I put my soul, I put my life in it<br>
			Look at me now<br>
			(Hey)<br>
			We're feeling dumb with coke and rum, we raise a glass to it<br>
			The underdogs<br>
			Oohh<br>
			(Hey). . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-afterhours-lyrics">more</a>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I been out walking<br>
			By the shore<br>
			The air was still<br>
			And still the water cold<br>
			And I want you to know<br>
			I'm thinking of you<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			This kind of chill<br>
			It helps me cope<br>
			I was so young to leave you all alone<br>
			And I want you to know<br>
			I'm thinking of you<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			All the pretty girls they find<br>
			The way to keep you on my mind<br>
			I swear I heard you singing along<br>
			Cities pass like into. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-buy-you-a-rose-lyrics">more</a>
