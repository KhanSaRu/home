			[Verse]<br>
			I&rsquo;m insecure<br>
			Of that I&rsquo;m sure<br>
			Don&rsquo;t need a counselor or seminar to see<br>
			And even when it&rsquo;s only you and me<br>
			There seems to be<br>
			Somethin&rsquo; that you keep behind your teeth<br>
			You think I would know<br>
			How this would go<br>
			But maybe that&rsquo;s exactly where I want it<br>
			No need to hope<br>
			Count to three<br>
			You get what you see<br>
			And every time you go, I&rsquo;m here thinkin&rsquo;<br>
			&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s me&rdquo;<br>
			Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm<br>
			You think I&rsquo;d know better by now<br>
			(By now, by now, by now, by now, by now, by now, by now, by now, 
			by now, by now, by now, by now...)

			[Intro]<br>
			Uh, alright<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I can&rsquo;t focus on what needs to get done<br>
			I&rsquo;m on notice hoping that you don&rsquo;t run, ah<br>
			You think I&rsquo;m tepid but I&rsquo;m misdiagnosed<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m a stalker, I seen all of your posts, ah-ah<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			And I&rsquo;m just tryna play it cool now<br>
			But that&rsquo;s not what I wanna do now<br>
			And I&rsquo;m not tryna be with you now, you now<br>
			Mhm<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			You make it difficult to not overthink<br>
			And when I&rsquo;m with you I turn all shades of pink, ah<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I hope that you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m rude<br>
			But I want to make out with you<br>
			And I&rsquo;m a little awkward, sure<br>
			But I could touch my face to yours, oh<br>
			And no one ever called me smooth<br>
			But I just wanna see the grooves<br>
			Between your hands, your teeth, oh<br>
			Tell me, do you think about me?<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I just wanna kiss you<br>
			And even if I miss you<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I&rsquo;ve got a radar for trouble and you&rsquo;re a renegade<br>
			I take a leap, and I stumble while you are unafraid<br>
			I keep repeating, repeating the way you say my name<br>
			Oh, oh (Mmm)<br>
			I try convincing my friends that you&rsquo;re not right for me<br>
			We just don&rsquo;t make any sense, but still, you fight for me<br>
			I keep repeating, repeating the way we shouldn&rsquo;t be<br>
			Oh, oh<br>

			[Chorus]<br>
			But I like the idea-dea of you<br>
			I like the idea-dea of you<br>
			Wonder how it&rsquo;d be, be to love you<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I don&rsquo;t want a piece of that<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I know there&rsquo;s no peace in that<br>
			I can tell myself a thousand times<br>
			But you can make a toy of me<br>
			And I&rsquo;ll agree that maybe I just couldn&rsquo;t see<br>
			Couldn&rsquo;t see that there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; wrong with us at all<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But you keep on playing games with me, games<br>
			And you always gotta play with me, play<br>
			And I hate the way you break and you take and you tear me down<br>

			It&rsquo;s 4 AM again<br>
			You think that I could sense a trend<br>
			I’m stayin&rsquo; up too late, just so I can stay awake<br>
			Wish I weren&rsquo;t so self-obsessed (Ah-ah)<br>
			Wish that I could be the best (Ah-ah, ah)<br>
