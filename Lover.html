			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			How many days did I spend thinking<br>
			&rsquo;Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?<br>
			Lived in the shade you were throwing<br>
			&rsquo;Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone<br>
			And I couldn&rsquo;t get away from ya<br>
			In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah<br>
			Your name on my lips, tongue-tied<br>
			Free rent, living in my mind<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			But then something happened one magical night<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I forgot that you existed<br>
			And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn&rsquo;t<br>
			And it was so nice<br>
			So peaceful and quiet<br>
			I forgot that. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-i-forgot-that-you-existed-lyrics">more</a></p>

			[Intro]<br>
			(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Fever dream high in the quiet of the night<br>
			You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you&rsquo;re right, I want it)<br>
			Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price<br>
			You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you&rsquo;re right, I want it)<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Killing me slow, out the window<br>
			I&rsquo;m always waiting for you to be waiting below<br>
			Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
			What doesn&rsquo;t kill me makes me want you more<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And it&rsquo;s new, the shape of your body<br>
			It&rsquo;s blue, the feeling I&rsquo;ve got<br>
			And it&rsquo;s ooh, whoa-oh<br>
			It&rsquo;s a cruel summer. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-cruel-summer-lyrics">more</a></p>
		<h1 id = "L">Lover </h1>
			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			We could leave the Christmas lights up &rsquo;til January<br>
			And this is our place, we make the rules<br>
			And there&rsquo;s a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear<br>
			Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Can I go where you go?<br>
			Can we always be this close?<br>
			Forever and ever, ah<br>
			Take me out and take me home<br>
			You&rsquo;re my, my, my, my lover<br>

			[Verse 2]<br>
			We could let our friends crash in the living room<br>
			This is our place, we make the call<br>
			And I&rsquo;m highly. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-lover-lyrics">more</a></p>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I would be complex, I would be cool<br>
			They&rsquo;d say I played the field before I found someone to commit to<br>
			And that would be okay for me to do<br>
			Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I&rsquo;d be a fearless leader, I&rsquo;d be an alpha type<br>
			When everyone believes ya, what&rsquo;s that like?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I&rsquo;m so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
			Wonderin&rsquo; if I&rsquo;d get there quicker if I was a man<br>
			And I&rsquo;m so sick of them comin&rsquo; at me again<br>
			&rsquo;Cause if I was a man, then I&rsquo;d be the man<br>
			I&rsquo;d be the man (Man)<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Combat, I&rsquo;m ready for combat<br>
			I say I don&rsquo;t want that, but what if I do?<br>
			&rsquo;Cause cruelty wins in the movies<br>
			I&rsquo;ve got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Easy they come, easy they go<br>
			I jump from the train, I ride off alone<br>
			I never grew up, it&rsquo;s getting so old<br>
			Help me hold on to you<br>
			<br>

			I&rsquo;ve been the archer, I&rsquo;ve been the prey<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I think he knows<br>
			His footprints on the sidewalk<br>
			Lead to where I can&rsquo;t stop<br>
			Go there every night<br>
			I think he knows<br>
			His hands around a cold glass<br>
			Make me wanna know that<br>
			Body like it&rsquo;s mine<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			He got that boyish look that I like in a man<br>
			I am an architect, I&rsquo;m drawing up the plans<br>
			It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m 17, nobody understands<br>
			No one understands<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			He got my heartbeat<br>
			Skipping down 16th Avenue<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			You know I adore you, I&rsquo;m crazier for you<br>
			Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene<br>
			Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing<br>
			I&rsquo;m lost in the lights<br>
			American glory faded before me<br>
			Now I&rsquo;m feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress<br>
			Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard<br>
			And ran for my life (Ah)<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			No cameras catch my pageant smile<br>
			I counted days, I counted miles<br>
			To see you there, to see you there<br>
			It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, but<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			It&rsquo;s you and me, that&rsquo;s my whole world<br>
			They whisper in the hallway, &ldquoShe&rsquo;s a bad, bad girl&rdquo (Okay)<br>
			The whole school is rolling fake dice<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			The moon is high<br>
			Like your friends were the night that we first met<br>
			Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet<br>
			Now I&rsquo;ve read all of the books beside your bed<br>
			The wine is cold<br>
			Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street<br>
			Cat and mouse for a month or two or three<br>
			Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			(Ayy)<br>
			Kiss me once &rsquo;cause you know I had a long night (Oh)<br>
			Kiss me twice &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s gonna be alright (Uh)<br>
			Three times &rsquo;cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I like shiny things, but I&rsquo;d marry you with paper rings<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			We were in the backseat<br>
			Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar<br>
			&ldquoI rent a place on Cornelia Street&rdquo<br>
			I say casually in the car<br>
			We were a fresh page on the desk<br>
			Filling in the blanks as we go<br>
			As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head<br>
			Leading us home<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends<br>
			I&rsquo;d never walk Cornelia Street again<br>
			That&rsquo;s the kinda heartbreak time could never mend<br>
			I&rsquo;d never walk Cornelia Street again<br>
			And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name<br>
			And baby, I&rsquo;m so terrified of if you ever walk away<br>

			Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts<br>
			Flashbacks waking me up<br>
			I get drunk, but it&rsquo;s not enough<br>
			&rsquo;Cause the morning comes and you&rsquo;re not my baby<br>
			I look through the windows of this love<br>
			Even though we boarded them up<br>

			I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal<br>
			And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey<br>
			But somethin&rsquo; happened, I heard him laughin&rsquo;<br>
			I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent<br>
			They say home is where the heart is<br>
			But that&rsquo;s not where mine lives<br>

			I enjoy walkin&rsquo; Camden Market in the afternoon<br>
