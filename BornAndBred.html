		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			You can sit at home and think about what could have been<br>
			You never know who’s watching or who could be a friend<br>
			I don’t mean to tell you that you’re hearing lies<br>
			But who is there to tell you when the last word is &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo;<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Go on take a chance, who knows if it’s true romance<br>
			But if you don’t try, you&rsquo;ll regret it for life<br>
			Why don’t you go on take a chance?<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Now you can try to tell me that you would&rsquo;ve cried<br>
			But I can try and tell you that you’re wasting your time<br>
			Living in the past when there is so much more<br>
			You’ll never figure. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-go-on-take-a-chance-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I admit I&rsquo;ve been running<br>
			From the problems day to day<br>
			Yesterday never seemed to pass<br>
			When we look to the promise<br>
			To find what we have lost<br>
			Tomorrow never seems to last<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			If only I could be a richer man<br>
			My problems and my worries would fall away<br>
			But even then, I&rsquo;ll find a plan<br>
			I&rsquo;m not afraid<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I don&rsquo;t regret the things I did here<br>
			Only the things I didn&rsquo;t say<br>
			When the time comes to begin here<br>
			I&rsquo;ll be there, I&rsquo;m not afraid<br>

		<p>
			[Intro]<br>
			Uh huh huh, let me tell you now, uh huh<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			When I had you to myself, I did one trip around<br>
			Those bitter faces always made you stand out in a crowd<br>
			Then someone picked you from the bunch, one glance is all it took<br>
			Now it&rsquo;s much delight for me, take a second look<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Oh, baby, give me one more chance (Show you that I love you)<br>
			Won&rsquo;t you please let me (Back in your hands)<br>
			Oh darling, I was blind to let you go (Let you go baby)<br>
			Now since I see you in his arms (I want you back)<br>

			Yes I do, now (I want you back)<br>

		<p>
			Look in my eyes<br>
			Tell me what you see<br>
			What works for you just may not work for me<br>
			I tell you one thing that I know<br>
			That it&rsquo;s a long long time before you have to grow<br>
			The way I&rsquo;ve grown<br>
			<br>
			And if you were me<br>
			Which I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d love to be<br>
			I can tell by your expression that you&rsquo;re scared<br>
			And if I were you<br>
			All the things that I could do<br>
			You can tell by my expression that I never would have to<br>
			<br>
			Cause&rsquo; we all have little secrets<br>
			That keep us hiding in your bed<br>
			Nothing&rsquo;s sold for free<br>

		<p>
			Day after day I&rsquo;m more confused<br>
			Yet I look for the light through the pouring rain<br>
			You know it&rsquo;s a game that I hate to lose<br>
			And I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; the strain, it ain&rsquo;t a shame<br>
			Oh, give me the beat boys, and free my soul<br>
			I want to get lost in rock and roll and drift away<br>
			Just give me the beat boys, and free my soul<br>
			I want to get lost in rock and roll and drift away<br>
			Won&rsquo;t you take me way<br>
			Beginning to think that I&rsquo;m wastin&rsquo; time<br>
			I don&rsquo;t understand the things I do<br>
			The world outside looks so unkind<br>

		<p>
			I need love, love<br>
			To ease my mind<br>
			I need to find, find<br>
			Someone to call mine<br>
			My mama said, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t hurry love<br>
			No, you just have to wait&rdquo;<br>
			She said, &ldquo;love don&rsquo;t come easy<br>
			It&rsquo;s a game of give and take&rdquo;<br>
			You can&rsquo;t hurry love<br>
			No, you just have to wait<br>
			You gotta just give it time<br>
			No matter how long it takes<br>
			But how many heartaches must I stand<br>
			Before I find a love to let me live again<br>
			Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on<br>
			When I feel my strength, yeah, it&rsquo;s almost gone<br>

			[Intro]<br>
			Hey, hey, hey!<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Ravens fly up in the sky<br>
			High above the mountain<br>
			Let&rsquo;s take a look at a babbling brook<br>
			Rising like a fountain<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Why not play us a song<br>
			With a piano in your pocket<br>
			And why not play us a tune<br>
			Before I have to go<br>

			[Verse 2]<br>
			Children sweat<br>
			Their mothers&rsquo; let them play out of their vision<br>
			Little do they know, they have to go<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I know I&rsquo;m not your typical boy<br>
			I know I&rsquo;m not your typical boy<br>
			But you ain&rsquo;t so typical yourself, you know (woah)<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			But none of it will last<br>
			When I think about the past and how we were such good friends<br>
			Oh, but all I do is cry when I think about &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo;<br>
			Because everyone deserves a second chance<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			There&rsquo;s a reason why I always look away<br>
			When you&rsquo;re talking bout&rsquo; the boys that take your breath away<br>

			And let me tell her one more time<br>

		<h2 id = "CS">Chelsea Street </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			In the town that never sleeps<br>
			Lullabies of traffic beeps<br>
			Soaring silver skyline by the piers<br>
			<br>
			There&rsquo;s a place I know well<br>
			Just south of kitchen&rsquo;s hell<br>
			The blaring sirens seem to disappear<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			So look out on these cobblestones<br>
			Just one more time<br>
			Watching all the passers by<br>
			Their purses and their ties<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			One more look around this place<br>
			Before you have to go (before you have to go)<br>
			I&rsquo;ll be waiting if you come on home<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Now I&rsquo;ve heard there was a secret chord<br>
			That David played, and it pleased the Lord<br>
			But you don&rsquo;t really care for music, do you?<br>
			It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth<br>
			The minor fall, the major lift<br>
			The baffled king composing &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo;<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
			Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
			You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
			Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you<br>
			She tied you to a kitchen chair<br>
			She broke your throne and she cut your hair<br>
			And from your lips. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-hallelujah-lyrics">more</a>

			I&rsquo;ve just seen a face<br>
			I can&rsquo;t forget the time or place<br>
			And we&rsquo;ve just met<br>
			She&rsquo;s just the girl for me<br>
			I want all the world to see<br>
			We&rsquo;ve met, whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo<br>
			Had it been another day<br>
			I might have looked the other way<br>
			And I had never been aware<br>
			And as it is I dream of her<br>
			Tonight, ni-ni-ni-ni&rsquo;n&rsquo;ni<br>
			Fallin&rsquo;, yes, I am fallin&rsquo;<br>
			And she keeps callin&rsquo;<br>

			Remember that country house we used to own<br>
			The one with the busted fence<br>
			We&rsquo;d sit on our porches and greet all the passers by<br>
			Not giving more than a glimpse<br>
			<br>
			In that little town off the border of Pittsburgh<br>
			We knew every face, every smile, every laugh<br>
			Remember the luster of a freshly dampened sidewalk<br>
			How the children would purposely Splash<br>

			I thought love was only true in fairy tales<br>
			Meant for someone else but not for me<br>
			Love was out to get me<br>
			That&rsquo;s the way it seemed<br>
			Disappointment haunted all of my dreams<br>
			Then I saw her face, now I&rsquo;m a believer<br>
			Without a trace, of doubt in my mind<br>
			I&rsquo;m in love, I&rsquo;m a believer<br>
			I couldn&rsquo;t leave her if I tried<br>
			I thought love was more or less a giving thing<br>
			Seems the more I gave the less I got<br>
			What&rsquo;s the use in tryin&rsquo;<br>
			All you get is pain<br>
			When I needed sunshine I got rain<br>
			Then I saw her face, now I&rsquo;m a believer<br>
			Without a trace, of doubt in my mind<br>
			I&rsquo;m in love, I&rsquo;m a believer<br>
