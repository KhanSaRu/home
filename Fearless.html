			[Verse 1]<br>
			There&rsquo;s something &rsquo;bout the way<br>
			The street looks when it&rsquo;s just rained<br>
			There&rsquo;s a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car<br>
			And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there<br>
			In the middle of the parking lot, yeah<br>
			Oh, yeah<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			We&rsquo;re driving down the road, I wonder if you know<br>
			I&rsquo;m trying so hard not to get caught up now<br>
			But you&rsquo;re just so cool, run your hands through your hair<br>
			Absentmindedly making me want you<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And I don&rsquo;t know how it gets better than this<br>
			You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless<br>
			And I don&rsquo;t know why but with you, I&rsquo;d dance<br>
			In a storm in my best. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/albums/Taylor-swift/Fearless-taylor-s-version">more</a>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors<br>
			It&rsquo;s the mornin&rsquo; of your very first day<br>
			You say hi to your friends you ain&rsquo;t seen in a while<br>
			Try and stay out of everybody&rsquo;s way<br>
			It&rsquo;s your freshman year and you&rsquo;re gonna be here<br>
			For the next four years in this town<br>
			Hopin&rsquo; one of those senior boys will wink at you and say<br>
			&ldquo;You know, I haven&rsquo;t seen you around before&rdquo;<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			&rsquo;Cause when you&rsquo;re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br>
			You&rsquo;re gonna believe them<br>
			And when you&rsquo;re fifteen, feelin&rsquo; like there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to figure out<br>
			Well, count to ten, take it in<br>
			This is life before you. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-fifteen-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			We were both young when I first saw you<br>
			I close my eyes, and the flashback starts<br>
			I&rsquo;m standing there<br>
			On a balcony in summer air<br>
			See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns<br>
			See you make your way through the crowd<br>
			And say, &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;<br>
			Little did I know<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles<br>
			And my daddy said, &ldquo;Stay away from Juliet&rdquo;<br>
			And I was crying on the staircase<br>
			Begging you, &ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; and I said<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
			I&rsquo;ll be waiting, all. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-love-story-lyrics">more</a>

			Mmm-mm, mm-mm<br>
			Mmm-mm, mm-mm<br>
			Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving<br>
			But I know I saw a light in you<br>
			And as we walked, we were talking<br>
			I didn&rsquo;t say half the things I wanted to<br>
			Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window<br>
			I&rsquo;ll be the one waiting there even when it&rsquo;s cold<br>
			Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing<br>
			I don&rsquo;t always have to be alone<br>
			<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			You&rsquo;re on the phone with your girlfriend, she&rsquo;s upset<br>
			She&rsquo;s going off about something that you said<br>
			&rsquo;Cause she doesn&rsquo;t get your humor like I do<br>
			I&rsquo;m in the room, it&rsquo;s a typical Tuesday night<br>
			I&rsquo;m listening to the kind of music she doesn&rsquo;t like<br>
			And she&rsquo;ll never know your story like I do<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts<br>
			She&rsquo;s Cheer Captain and I&rsquo;m on the bleachers<br>
			Dreaming &rsquo;bout the day when you wake up and find<br>
			That what you&rsquo;re looking for has been here the whole time<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			If you could see that I&rsquo;m the one who understands you<br>
			Been here all along, so why can&rsquo;t you see?<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]<br>
			I see your face in my mind as I drive away<br>
			&rsquo;Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way<br>
			People are people and sometimes, we change our minds<br>
			But it&rsquo;s killing me to see you go after all this time<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]<br>
			Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie<br>
			It&rsquo;s the kind of ending you don&rsquo;t really wanna see<br>
			&rsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s tragedy and it&rsquo;ll only bring you down<br>
			Now, I don&rsquo;t know what to be without you around<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]<br>
			And we know it&rsquo;s never simple, never easy<br>
			Never a clean break, no one here to save me<br>

			I took a chance, I took a shot<br>
			And you might think I&rsquo;m bulletproof, but I&rsquo;m not<br>
			You took a swing, I took it hard<br>
			And down here from the ground, I see who you are<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I&rsquo;m sick and tired of your attitude<br>
			I&rsquo;m feeling like I don&rsquo;t know you<br>
			You tell me that you love me, then cut me down<br>
			And I need you like a heartbeat<br>
			But you know you got a mean streak<br>
			That makes me run for cover when you&rsquo;re around<br>
			And here&rsquo;s to you and your temper<br>
			Yes, I remember what you said last night<br>
			And I know that you see what you&rsquo;re doing to me<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around<br>
			I&rsquo;ve been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down<br>
			And it&rsquo;s taken me this long, baby, but I&rsquo;ve figured you out<br>
			And you&rsquo;re thinking we&rsquo;ll be fine again, but not this time around<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			You don&rsquo;t have to call anymore<br>
			I won&rsquo;t pick up the phone<br>
			This is the last straw<br>
			Don&rsquo;t wanna hurt anymore<br>
			And you can tell me that you&rsquo;re sorry<br>
			But I don&rsquo;t believe you, baby, like I did before<br>
			You&rsquo;re not sorry (No, no, no, no)<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			You&rsquo;re looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn&rsquo;t know<br>
			Could&rsquo;ve loved you all my life if you hadn&rsquo;t left me waiting in the cold<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			He is sensible and so incredible<br>
			And all my single friends are jealous<br>
			He says everything I need to hear and it&rsquo;s like<br>
			I couldn&rsquo;t ask for anything better<br>
			He opens up my door and I get into his car<br>
			And he says you look beautiful tonight<br>
			And I feel perfectly fine<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain<br>
			And it&rsquo;s 2AM and I&rsquo;m cursing your name<br>
			You&rsquo;re so in love that you act insane<br>
			And that&rsquo;s the way I loved you<br>
			Breaking down and coming undone<br>
			It&rsquo;s a roller coaster kind of rush<br>
			And I never knew I could feel that much<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			Once upon a time<br>
			I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye<br>
			And we caught onto something<br>
			I hold onto the night<br>
			You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me<br>
			Were you just kidding?<br>
			&rsquo;Cause it seems to me<br>
			This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak<br>
			I don&rsquo;t feel welcome anymore<br>
			Baby, what happened? Please, tell me<br>
			&rsquo;Cause one second, it was perfect<br>
			Now you&rsquo;re halfway out the door<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And I stare at the phone, he still hasn&rsquo;t called<br>
			And then you feel so low you can&rsquo;t feel nothing at all<br>
			And you flashback to when he said, &ldquo;Forever and always&rdquo;<br>
			Oh, and it rains in your bedroom<br>
			Everything is wrong<br>
			It rains when you&rsquo;re here and it rains when you&rsquo;re gone<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I&rsquo;m five years old, it&rsquo;s getting cold, I&rsquo;ve got my big coat on<br>
			I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run<br>
			Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides<br>
			Look now, the sky is gold<br>
			I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I don&rsquo;t know why all the trees change in the fall<br>
			But I know you&rsquo;re not scared of anything at all<br>
			Don&rsquo;t know if Snow White&rsquo;s house is near or far away<br>
			But I know I had the best day with you today<br>

			[Verse 2]<br>
			I&rsquo;m thirteen now<br>
			And don&rsquo;t know how my friends could be so mean<br>

		<h1 id = "C">Change </h1>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			And it&rsquo;s a sad picture, the final blow hits you<br>
			Somebody else gets what you wanted again and<br>
			You know it&rsquo;s all the same, another time and place<br>
			Repeating history and you&rsquo;re getting sick of it<br>
			But I believe in whatever you do<br>
			And I&rsquo;ll do anything to see it through<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Because these things will change<br>
			Can you feel it now?<br>
			These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down<br>
			This revolution, the time will come<br>
			For us to finally win<br>
			And we&rsquo;ll sing hallelujah, we&rsquo;ll sing hallelujah<br>
