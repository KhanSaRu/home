			[Intro]
Meet me at midnight

[Verse 1]
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don&rsquo;t ever say too much
And you don&rsquo;t really read into
My melancholia

[Pre-Chorus]
I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
I feel
The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-lavender-haze-lyrics">more</a>

			[Verse 1]
When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
&rsquo;Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
"How&rsquo;d we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say
"Your roommate&rsquo;s cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that&rsquo;s how"
I see you every day now

[Chorus]
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-maroon-lyrics">more</a>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I&rsquo;ve ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I&rsquo;ll watch as you&rsquo;re leaving
&rsquo;Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It&rsquo;s me, hi
I&rsquo;m the problem. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-anti-hero-lyrics">more</a>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he&rsquo;s gonna notice me
It&rsquo;s okay, we&rsquo;re the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you&rsquo;re smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it&rsquo;s your face
I didn&rsquo;t choose this town, I dream of getting out
There&rsquo;s just one who could make me stay
All my days

[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-youre-on-you-own-kid-lyrics">more</a>

			[Intro]
Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 1]
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart &rsquo;cause he was nice
He was sunshine. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-midnight-rain-lyrics">more</a>

			<p>
			[Intro]
I remember

[Verse 1]
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing goin&rsquo; on
I swear that it was somethin&rsquo;
&rsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I&rsquo;ve searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin&rsquo; situations, circumstances
Miscommunications, and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations

[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-question-lyrics">more</a>

		<h1 id = "VS">Vigilante Shit </h1>
			<p>
			[Verse 1]
Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I&rsquo;m the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one&rsquo;ll be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don&rsquo;t dress for women
I don&rsquo;t dress for men
Lately, I&rsquo;ve been dressin&rsquo; for revenge

[Chorus]
I don&rsquo;t start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don&rsquo;t get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don&rsquo;t dress for friends
Lately, I&rsquo;ve been dressin&rsquo;. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-vigilante-shit-lyrics">more</a>

		<h1 id = "B">Bejeweled </h1>
			<p>
			[Verse 1]
Baby love, I think I&rsquo;ve been a little too kind
Didn&rsquo;t notice you walkin&rsquo; all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin&rsquo; someone first only works when you&rsquo;re in their top five
And by the way, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; out tonight

[Chorus]
Best believe I&rsquo;m still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don&rsquo;t remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don&rsquo;t put mе in the basement
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-bejeweled-lyrics">more</a>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]
"It only hurts this much right now"
Was what I was thinkin&rsquo; the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; over you my whole life

[Pre-Chorus]
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can&rsquo;t last

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, I&rsquo;m fallin&rsquo; in love
Oh no, I&rsquo;m fallin&rsquo; in love again
Oh, I&rsquo;m fallin&rsquo; in love
I thought the plane was goin&rsquo; down
How&rsquo;d you turn. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-labyrinth-lyrics">more</a>

		<h1 id = "K">Karma </h1>
			<p>
			[Verse 1]
You&rsquo;re talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you&rsquo;re relevant
You&rsquo;re terrified to look down
&rsquo;Cause if you dare, you&rsquo;ll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It&rsquo;s coming back around

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn&rsquo;t know what I mean

[Chorus]
&rsquo;Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma&rsquo;s a relaxing thought
Aren&rsquo;t you envious that for you it&rsquo;s not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-karma-lyrics">more</a>

		<h1 id = "SN">Sweet Nothing </h1>
			<p>
			[Verse 1]
I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
They said the end is comin&rsquo;
Everyone’s up to somethin&rsquo;
I find myself runnin&rsquo; home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they’re push and shovin&rsquo;
You&rsquo;re in the kitchen hummin&rsquo;
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin&rsquo;

[Verse 2]
On the way home
I wrote a poem. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-sweet-nothing-lyrics">more</a>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time

[Pre-Chorus]
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn&rsquo;t lose

[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-mastermind-lyrics">more</a>
