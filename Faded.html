			[Verse 1]<br>
			Hey, I heard you&rsquo;re doing better, never knew you as a quitter<br>
			And I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re doing okay<br>
			I don&rsquo;t know if you remember all the times you wrote me letters<br>
			And I think you took me out in fifth grade<br>
			And I think I told you no, I said I wanna take it slow<br>
			And I also called you gross to your face<br>
			But I think everybody knows it was just a funny joke<br>
			So do you wanna go on that date?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I&rsquo;ve been feeling quite amazing flying kites with you<br>
			Rephrasing words from songs that I wrote myself<br>
			It ain&rsquo;t good for my health<br>
			But I spend nights thinkin&rsquo; of you<br>
			I write you songs when I miss you<br>
			I promise I&rsquo;ll be there to help<br>
			Though I might need. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-lovesick-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "T">Toxic </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			All my friends are toxic, all ambitionless<br>
			So rude and always negative<br>
			I need new friends, but it&rsquo;s not that quick and easy<br>
			Oh, I&rsquo;m drowning, let me breathe<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I&rsquo;m better off all by myself<br>
			Though I&rsquo;m feeling kinda empty without somebody else<br>
			Oh, I hear you crying out for help<br>
			But you never showed for me when I was ringing your cell phone<br>
			Oh, you don&rsquo;t know how it feels to be alone<br>
			Baby, oh, I&rsquo;ll make you know, I&rsquo;ll make you know, oh<br>
			<br>
			[Bridge]<br>
			(Oh, I&rsquo;m drowning, let me breathe)<br>
			(I&rsquo;m drowning, let me breathe)<br>
			(Oh, I&rsquo;m drowning, let me breathe)<br>
			(I&rsquo;m drowning, let me breathe)<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			But life is immaculate, backin&rsquo; it up a bit<br>
			Countin&rsquo; my hours and knockin&rsquo; on wood<br>
			Avoidin&rsquo; my. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-toxic-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I keep my windows open, front door&rsquo;s broken, I lost my keys<br>
			I&rsquo;m passed out on my futon, gave back your DVD&rsquo;s<br>
			It&rsquo;s been so long, but you&rsquo;re embedded to my thoughts<br>
			And all the songbirds sing sad songs<br>
			Oh, how I treated you so wrong?<br>
			I stay up all night long<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I see you on the TV<br>
			You&rsquo;re in my melatonin dreams<br>
			I put my health beneath me<br>
			But it&rsquo;s frustrating that we weren&rsquo;t meant to be<br>
			I&rsquo;m wasted on the sofa<br>
			Watching time fly, wearing loafers on my feet<br>
			Restless &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m lost without you<br>
			Kinda awkward. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-loafers-lyrics">more</a>
