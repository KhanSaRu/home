		[Verse 1]<br>
		You were, too much<br>
		And all at once, you were, just enough<br>
		You&rsquo;re just right, you&rsquo;re the perfect temp<br>
		You&rsquo;re my coffee cup when I&rsquo;ve over slept<br>
		You are, complete<br>
		The final cord in the even beat<br>
		You&rsquo;re the perfect rhyme, in the perfect time<br>
		So please can I, make you mine<br>
		<br>
		[Chorus]<br>
		Don&rsquo;t wanna make do, just wanna tell you, I like you<br>
		Bells keep ringing<br>
		Don&rsquo;t wanna get by, Can&rsquo;t keep it inside, I like you<br>
		My heart keeps singing<br>

		<p>
		You met me in my dreams last night<br>
		Same dark eyes, familiar sight<br>
		Broken words I&rsquo;ve dreamt a hundred times<br>
		But you were strange and staggered too<br>
		Like what you said I&rsquo;d scripted through<br>
		I guess this means I&rsquo;m getting over you<br>
		Why do I still dream of you?<br>
		Why do you still come?<br>
		Is it to remind me of the evil things I&rsquo;ve done?<br>
		Why am I still followed by your ghost memory<br>
		And why do I still hope you think of me?<br>
		<br>
		Every night inside my bed<br>
		You creep into my head<br>
		I am just a b-b-b-broken<br>
		Broken record<br>
		Every night inside my dream<br>
		I replay the same old thing<br>
		I am just a b-b-b. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Tessa-violet-broken-record-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		Do you feel big when you&rsquo;re tearing people down?<br>
		Do you feel better when they&rsquo;re lying on the ground?<br>
		Do you love the rumor mill? Do you love to call them names?<br>
		Are you powerful when you get to shift the blame?<br>
		Talk, talk, talk about mistakes your friends have made<br>
		Talk, talk all about how different you&rsquo;d behave<br>
		<br>
		[Chorus]<br>
		Always a victim, just caught in the middle<br>
		You talk so much, but you say so little<br>
		Do you feel big and better than it all<br>
		Or do you just feel small?<br>
		O-oh<br>
		<br>
		Are you tippy-top when you get your turn to talk?<br>
		Do you feel better when your friends all laugh and nod<br>
		About that blonde that went and got all the things you thought you want<br>
		Preaching, "I&rsquo;m not jealous. I&rsquo;m just saying:<br>
		The boy she&rsquo;s got, I should. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Tessa-violet-small-lyrics">more</a>

		[Verse 1]<br>
		I don&rsquo;t want to be a human anymore<br>
		I&rsquo;m done<br>
		I don&rsquo;t want to make mistakes anymore<br>
		He&rsquo;s won<br>
		<br>
		[Pre-Chorus 1]<br>
		I&rsquo;m too old to change<br>
		Take my heart and I&rsquo;ll restart<br>
		Please just let me fall apart<br>
		You may say it&rsquo;s strange<br>
		But I quit, guess that&rsquo;s it<br>
		For a human, I&rsquo;m unfit, so<br>

		It&rsquo;s hot before the rain comes<br>
		It&rsquo;s cool once its passed<br>
		The winter was a long one<br>
		But the summers come at last<br>
		We were driving round and round<br>
		Just to see what we would see<br>
		When you think of fireflies<br>
		Do you ever think of me?<br>
		<br>
		Kiss me like you used to<br>
		Show me that you care<br>
		I can&rsquo;t help but miss you<br>
		When I feel that summer air<br>

		Do you remember<br>
		Meeting on pine and sand<br>
		You kept bumping into me<br>

		Summer walks and<br>
		Skipping rocks and<br>
		How he talks<br>
		&rsquo;bout my blue Reeboks<br>
		Down an old dirt road where<br>
		There&rsquo;s nowhere to go but<br>
		Into you, into you<br>
		By the willow tree where<br>
		It&rsquo;s just you and me, we&rsquo;ll say<br>
		"I love you," "I love you too."<br>
		<br>
		Meet me in memory in Tennessee<br>
		Where the sky is filled with stars<br>
		And your heart is filled with me<br>
		Heat meets the night and your kiss with me<br>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]<br>
		You were a prince<br>
		Or so I thought<br>
		You swept me off my feet then carried me off<br>
		Spent time with me<br>
		Just us two<br>
		As long as it wasn&rsquo;t too inconvenient for you<br>
		<br>
		[Pre-Chorus]<br>
		He&rsquo;s a bulldozer, so move out of the way<br>
		&rsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re not in the plan until another day<br>
		He&rsquo;s so hardheaded so you&rsquo;d best get along<br>
		&rsquo;Cause he don&rsquo;t need forgiveness if he&rsquo;s never wrong<br>
		<br>
		[Chorus]<br>
		Now, I&rsquo;m not sorry to leave you on your own<br>
		I&rsquo;m not sorry; leave your message at the tone. [beep]<br>
		I&rsquo;m not sorry, and you can disagree<br>
		Sorry, I&rsquo;m not sorry<br>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]<br>
		I just re-realized that someday I will die<br>
		Fill my lungs before I&rsquo;m done so I can say goodbye<br>
		Tell me will I look around and think of all I&rsquo;ve cared for<br>
		Will you be there by my side? I hope you&rsquo;ll say a prayer for me<br>
		<br>
		Sand keeps slipping through the glass and<br>
		Time is slipping through the cracks and<br>
		Every minute come to pass a minute that I can&rsquo;t get back<br>
		It&rsquo;s gone, it&rsquo;s gone away<br>
		<br>

		If time is worth its weight in gold<br>
		I&rsquo;ll be rich when I grow old<br>
		But riches are worth nothing boo, if I can&rsquo;t spend it all with you so<br>

		Hello, I know that we don&rsquo;t talk<br>
		But still you whisper in my thoughts<br>
		You cry, please don&rsquo;t cry<br>
		You told me that you had to go<br>
		Although you said you loved me so<br>
		I know, hello<br>

		Hair of gold and eyes of blue<br>
		Teach her how to be like you<br>
		Magazines taped to her wall<br>
		Easier to count her flaws<br>
		<br>
		One for dessert<br>
		One for the hurt<br>
		One for the blame of a life that&rsquo;s led by shame<br>
		<br>
		Beauty comes and beauty goes<br>
		When comes hers? Oh, no one knows<br>
		Failing grades but it&rsquo;s okay<br>
		No one&rsquo;s counting anyway<br>
		<br>
		One for the drink<br>
		One so she won&rsquo;t think<br>
		One punishing for the boy who said don&rsquo;t sing<br>

		[Verse 1]<br>
		I&rsquo;m embarrassed to say I still think about you<br>
		Every day<br>
		Little things like "catsup" and "ketchup"<br>
		Keep catchin&rsquo; me<br>
		I bookmarked something you might like<br>
		Oh, how creepy I&rsquo;ve become<br>
		But you don&rsquo;t think about me<br>
		Now that we&rsquo;re done<br>
		<br>
		[Verse 1]<br>
		I wanted to say "I wish you were here," but<br>
		That&rsquo;d be weird<br>
		I wanted tell you the pup at the park says<br>
		"Bark, bark, bark"<br>
		And you would laugh and text me back<br>
		A joke, I&rsquo;d be outdone<br>
