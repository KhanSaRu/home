		[Intro]
Your eyes are open, so never close them
You'll sail the ocean, finding where you should be
And if you're broken, you'll make your own thing
You'll make it so big for all the world to see
You'll make it so damn big for all the world to see

[Verse 1: Jack Met]
I'm kinda scared to drop this album
Let's push it back another week
I wanna be next up forever
Find a way to never hit my peak
I kinda wish I was still a virgin
Dying to finally see what sex is like
I wanna be next up forever
Forever, I'll be second in line. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-next-up-forever-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]
This hospital's got lots of cryin' kids
A minute ago, I did not exist
It's nice to finally meet my relatives
I bet it's always gonna stay this fun
I bet it's easy stayin' 'way from drugs
I bet our parents always stay in love
Always stay in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Me, my, oh, what a life
So me and all my people gon' be stepping in time (Wow)
Me, my, oh, what a life
So me and all my people gon' be stepping in time

[Chorus]
So thank you
For coming to my birthday party
I am one-minute-old today
And everything is going great (Oh)
Thank you. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-birthday-party-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]
Remember when we all got drunk?
I ended up with two broke thumbs
Oh my God, I felt so dumb, lucky me
I wrote a song that no one knows
I played a show and no one showed
Oh my God, I felt so alone, lucky me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah) When all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
(Ah) What you gonna do? Who you gonna tell?

[Chorus]
Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-100-bad-days-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1: Jack Met]
My new address is hard to remember
So I wrote it on the back of my hand
'Cause I leave the nest this coming December
To make it as a grown man
I’m 'bout to lose my only defenders
I'm packing up whatever I can

[Pre-Chorus: All]
Been waiting for today, but
All I can think to say is

[Chorus: Jack Met with Ryan Met]
Oh no, don’t throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go?
What if I come back home, back home?
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go?
What if I come back home. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-dont-throw-out-my-legos-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Intro: Jack Met]
Okay!
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1: Jack Met]
You run your mouth, your tongue fell out
It's right there on the ground
But now, you'll never drown
You can't, you got no mouth
So it ain't all bad now

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
What doesn't kill you makes you ugly
Life gives you lemons
At least it gave you something

[Chorus: Jack Met]
Okay!
So if I break my face, and I don't look so great
My face is just my. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-break-my-face-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1: Ryan Met]
I am not chosen, or that unique
Honestly, you were and you chose me
Maybe I fucked up everything
Is this how it feels to be blue?
You said you'd love me, no matter what
You said you'd love me, is that what I loved?
All of these choices messed me up
And everyone's mean, except you

[Chorus: Ryan Met]
I think I probably wasn't in love with you
I think I probably loved the idea of you
And though I may be missing the feel of you
I think I probably wasn't in love with you
I said it 'cause I no longer wanna hurt
I said it back to you 'cause you said it first
And though I may be wishing it wasn't true
I think I probably wasn't in love
I wasn’t in love with you. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-turning-out-pt-ii-lyrics">more</a>

		[Chorus: Jack Met]
But oh my, oh my God
The entertainment's here
Everything is suddenly amazing here
Sit back, man
Relax, man
Sit back, man

[Verse 1: Jack Met]
I used to be distracted by my favorite song
I loved it very much, I made the song my alarm
And now I kind of hate hearing it every morn
Don’t wake up anymore, I don't wanna be bored
I used to be distracted, rolling 'round in the dirt
But recently, I’m thinking 'bout my purpose on Earth
But I don't wanna think about my purpose no more
Because it may come up short
Man, I hate being bored. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-the-entertainments-here-lyrics">more</a>

		[Chorus: Jack Met]
I've been so good
I've been helpful and friendly
I've been so good
Why am I feeling empty?
I've been so good
I've been so good this year
I've been so good
But it's still getting harder
I've been so good
Where the hell is the karma?
I've been so good
I've been so good this year

[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Why are you asking me why?
My days and nights are filled with disappointment
Fine, oh, no, everything's fine
I'm not sure why I booked. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-karma-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Okay, people laugh at my jokes now
Yeah, it’s so strange to have a bit of success
Now our song plays in the produce aisle
What if some day, you say, "Who the hell is that?"
Okay, this all could be over by the next day
So should I make famous friends?
Now our song plays in the produce aisle
What if some day you say, "Who the hell is that?"

[Chorus: Jack Met]
Would Beats by Dre pay 20K
For us to say that they are great?
Recording costs for this whole song
Could all be paid by Beats by Dre

		<p>
		[Chorus: Jack Met]
Frankly, I’m scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk, it’s like, "Wow, I’m not crazy"
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)

[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Don’t kill me 'cause I’m just the messenger
I already went and took my temperature
And I’m not sick, I took all my vitamins
Yeah, I’m not sick, I’m just kinda different

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Oh, different, so different
They tell us to be different
But no one told me I could go too far

		[Verse 1]
Dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I hope they don't make fun of you
When you grow up and go to school, okay?
'Cause Winter is a badass name
Dear Winter, I hope you talk to girls
Or boys or anyone you like
I just hope you don't stay in every night
'Cause I wish I was out tonight

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
It really doesn't seem like there's anyone for me
But dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I'm hoping that some day, I can meet you on this Earth
But shit, I gotta meet your mom first

Dear Winter, I hope you like this song

Don't you go, we need you here
You brighten up this shitty year
Well, congratulations on your bit of success
We can't wait to see what you do next

Come outside, come outside
You fell low, but now you're high
You been outside, been outside
So go ahead and do it one more time
Come outside, come outside
You went hard, and you did fine
You been outside, been outside
So go ahead and do it one more time (Do it one more time)
