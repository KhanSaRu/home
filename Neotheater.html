			[Intro]<br>
			Your eyes are open, so never close them<br>
			You&rsquo;ll sail the ocean, finding where you should be<br>
			And if you&rsquo;re broken, you&rsquo;ll make your own thing<br>
			You&rsquo;ll make it so big for all the world to see<br>
			You&rsquo;ll make it so damn big for all the world to see<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			I&rsquo;m kinda scared to drop this album<br>
			Let&rsquo;s push it back another week<br>
			I wanna be next up forever<br>
			Find a way to never hit my peak<br>
			I kinda wish I was still a virgin<br>
			Dying to finally see what sex is like<br>
			I wanna be next up forever<br>
			Forever, I&rsquo;ll be second in line. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-next-up-forever-lyrics">more</a>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			This hospital&rsquo;s got lots of cryin&rsquo; kids<br>
			A minute ago, I did not exist<br>
			It&rsquo;s nice to finally meet my relatives<br>
			I bet it&rsquo;s always gonna stay this fun<br>
			I bet it&rsquo;s easy stayin&rsquo; &rsquo;way from drugs<br>
			I bet our parents always stay in love<br>
			Always stay in love<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Remember when we all got drunk?<br>
			I ended up with two broke thumbs<br>
			Oh my God, I felt so dumb, lucky me<br>
			I wrote a song that no one knows<br>
			I played a show and no one showed<br>
			Oh my God, I felt so alone, lucky me<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			(Ah) When all is going wrong and you&rsquo;re scared as hell<br>
			(Ah) What you gonna do? Who you gonna tell?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories<br>
			A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties<br>
			A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories<br>
			A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah<br>
			No, I ain&rsquo;t scared of you<br>

			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			My new address is hard to remember<br>
			So I wrote it on the back of my hand<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I leave the nest this coming December<br>
			To make it as a grown man<br>
			I’m &rsquo;bout to lose my only defenders<br>
			I&rsquo;m packing up whatever I can<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: All]<br>
			Been waiting for today, but<br>
			All I can think to say is<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Jack Met with Ryan Met]<br>
			Oh no, don’t throw out my Legos<br>
			What if I can&rsquo;t let go?<br>
			What if I come back home, back home?<br>
			Oh no, don&rsquo;t throw out my Legos<br>

			[Intro: Jack Met]<br>
			Okay!<br>
			Ah, ah, ah<br>

			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			You run your mouth, your tongue fell out<br>
			It&rsquo;s right there on the ground<br>
			But now, you&rsquo;ll never drown<br>
			You can&rsquo;t, you got no mouth<br>
			So it ain&rsquo;t all bad now<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			What doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you ugly<br>
			Life gives you lemons<br>
			At least it gave you something<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: Ryan Met]<br>
			I am not chosen, or that unique<br>
			Honestly, you were and you chose me<br>
			Maybe I fucked up everything<br>
			Is this how it feels to be blue?<br>
			You said you&rsquo;d love me, no matter what<br>
			You said you&rsquo;d love me, is that what I loved?<br>
			All of these choices messed me up<br>
			And everyone&rsquo;s mean, except you<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Ryan Met]<br>
			I think I probably wasn&rsquo;t in love with you<br>
			I think I probably loved the idea of you<br>
			And though I may be missing the feel of you<br>
			I think I probably wasn&rsquo;t in love with you<br>
			I said it &rsquo;cause I no longer wanna hurt<br>
			I said it back to you &rsquo;cause you said it first<br>
			And though I may be wishing it wasn&rsquo;t true<br>
			I think I probably wasn&rsquo;t in love<br>

			Everything is suddenly amazing here<br>
			Sit back, man<br>
			Relax, man<br>
			Sit back, man<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			I used to be distracted by my favorite song<br>
			I loved it very much, I made the song my alarm<br>
			And now I kind of hate hearing it every morn<br>
			Don’t wake up anymore, I don&rsquo;t wanna be bored<br>
			I used to be distracted, rolling &rsquo;round in the dirt<br>
			But recently, I’m thinking &rsquo;bout my purpose on Earth<br>
			But I don&rsquo;t wanna think about my purpose no more<br>

			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			Okay, people laugh at my jokes now<br>
			Yeah, it’s so strange to have a bit of success<br>
			Now our song plays in the produce aisle<br>
			What if some day, you say, &ldquo;Who the hell is that?&rdquo;<br>

			And I’m not sick, I took all my vitamins<br>
			Yeah, I’m not sick, I’m just kinda different<br>
