		<p id = "Top">I have multiple musical artists that I really like. Presently I&rsquo;have been obsessed with paramore. This 
		band is only one of the many other	artists I like. The list includes Taylor Swift, Masie Peters, StrayKids, 
		BoyWithUke and many more. There is one artist that I love more than	the rest. They are StrayKids. Even 
		though they are a kpop band with music mostly in the Korean language, I relate a lot to their lyrics.</p>

		<h3>Discography</h3>
		<p>Taylor swift has a very long <a href = "https://www.classicrockhistory.com/complete-list-of-taylor-swift-studio-albums-and-songs/"> 
		discography.</a> If I wanted to list all of them it would take a really long time. Instead to make it easier to read I will only be adding
		the names of her albums on this page. Each album will take you to a different page with more comprehensive information regarding song, 
		length and even lyrics. There will also be a list of awards won by Taylor Swift since she is a world reknown artist. </p>

		<h2>AJR</h2>
		<p>A simple but interesting thing to note about the name of the band relates to the names of </p>
		<p>the members. The band name &lsquo;AJR&rsquo; comes from the first names of the three members. Something </p>
		<p>else to look for in the names of the members are their last names. The same last name might </p>
		<p>indicate to people that the members might be siblings. You would be correct if you though </p>
		<p>this. This small indie band started a very long time ago in the streets of New York. They </p>
		<p>would busk in the streets for hours, and now they are a billboard famous band to look up to. </p>
