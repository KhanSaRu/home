			[Intro]<br>
			There&rsquo;s a hundred miles from you and I<br>
			And so many signs to forget you<br>
			And though I might be wrong<br>
			And though I write shit songs<br>
			I know it won&rsquo;t be long &rsquo;til I see you<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Sorry, but I just can&rsquo;t stop liking you<br>
			I hope these other guys won&rsquo;t see you<br>
			Oh, so pretty like I do, please, don&rsquo;t break my heart<br>
			It&rsquo;s hard enough to heal arteries without glue<br>
			I&rsquo;ll see it through if you&rsquo;re down to<br>
			I&rsquo;ll see you soon &rsquo;cause I miss you<br>
			<br>
			[Verse]<br>
			I might go too high though, I&rsquo;m typing all these typos<br>
			&rsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re the sight I see when I&rsquo;m falling off of my tightrope<br>
			And you&rsquo;re the life that flashes through my eyes when I will die<br>
			So I apologize, it&rsquo;s kinda hard for me to lose what I know<br>
			And I won&rsquo;t go too low. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-far-away-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "LD">Long Drives </h2>
		<p>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Yeah, I can&rsquo;t do these long drives sittin&rsquo; in the back seat<br>
			Thinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout that one night when the world caught fire (You&rsquo;re driving me crazy)<br>
			Baby, and your eyes brightened up this dark scene<br>
			You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar (You&rsquo;re driving me crazy)<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			We just FaceTime, is this a sign? I&rsquo;m fallin&rsquo; out of your life<br>
			I try my hardest not to think about what I just realized<br>
			You said I was your light, I think that&rsquo;s just a white lie<br>
			Feelin&rsquo; so rotten inside thought I died<br>
			I kinda wanna go back, I&rsquo;m missin&rsquo; the pain<br>
			Of a heartbreak and life just don&rsquo;t hit the same<br>
			I&rsquo;m havin&rsquo; migraines, my friends all over the place<br>
			With their lifes straight, I guess I&rsquo;m afraid<br>
			Of growin&rsquo; out of my place<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I can&rsquo;t do these long drives sittin&rsquo; in the back seat<br>
			Thinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout that one night when the world caught fire (You&rsquo;re driving me crazy). . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-long-drives-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Baby, let&rsquo;s pack our bags and head to wherever<br>
			Toss these plans out straight through the door<br>
			Won&rsquo;t you take my hand? It won&rsquo;t be forever<br>
			I don&rsquo;t have to be the one you&rsquo;re looking for<br>
			But I broke my foot, got lost on the mountain<br>
			Fucked my life again, but I&rsquo;m sure<br>
			That you&rsquo;re not too far behind, so I&rsquo;m counting<br>
			On you to stay when my heart is sore<br>
			Oh, hey, aye, I think I lost my way<br>
			Can you put me back in place? (Hahaha)<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I know you&rsquo;d never let me down<br>
			But will you lift me off the ground?<br>
			Do you even know my name?<br>
			And even when I&rsquo;m safe and sound<br>
			It could always turn around<br>
			But can you remember. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-let-me-down-lyrics">more</a>

			[Intro: BoyWithUke]<br>
			Ooh, alright, final take<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1: BoyWithUke]<br>
			Uh oh, what have you done?<br>
			Lock me up, I&rsquo;ve fallen in love<br>
			Get me out of here, I said get me out of here<br>
			And I have homework and shit I need to do<br>
			Late assignments and papers overdue<br>
			I&rsquo;m all out of tears, blurry nights won&rsquo;t disappear<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: BoyWithUke]<br>
			I was in my bed, I tried to sleep<br>
			I held my breath, I was too weak<br>
			I fell into your open arms<br>
			You&rsquo;ll break my heart, take it too far<br>
			But I don&rsquo;t care, this isn&rsquo;t fair<br>
			I love the way you do your hair<br>
			I love the way you write your name<br>
			I love the way—<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: BoyWithUke]<br>
			You&rsquo;re driving me crazy, you&rsquo;re driving me mad<br>

		<h2 id = "SSN">She Said No </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Stood together outside, I don&rsquo;t even know what<br>
			Was going through my mind, now I think it was love<br>
			I never knew I could find someone who I thought was dumb<br>
			But made my heart go, &ldquo;Ba-da-dum, ba-da-dum&rdquo;<br>
			And I was so scared for my life, but I said that I would rather try<br>
			And I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m out of time (Hahaha)<br>
			And I throw my meds straight into the mud<br>
			&rsquo;Cause it doesn&rsquo;t seem to help me when I&rsquo;m falling in love<br>
			And my stomach hurts, but I don&rsquo;t mention the blood<br>
			I think I might need a doctor for the mess that I&rsquo;ve become<br>
			Oh, I found it hard to breathe<br>
			It&rsquo;s getting dark out, don&rsquo;t you think?<br>
			Tell me or is it just me?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Then she took my coat &rsquo;cause it was cold<br>
			And we took pictures with her phone<br>
			She left her Polaroid at home<br>
			I texted all my friends I wrote that;<br>

		<h2 id = "HOI">Heart Of Ice </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I thought there was something wrong with my life<br>
			I thought I was hopeless, thinking I&rsquo;m out of time<br>
			And nothing could change it and nobody knew<br>
			I thought I was breaking and then I met you<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Oh my, you&rsquo;re so fine, can&rsquo;t write you out my mind<br>
			I like it when you lie to me, I love it when you try to be<br>
			Wild, bitchy, impolite, somehow stuck in my sights<br>
			I like that you&rsquo;re not nice to me, I love your heart of ice<br>
			<br>
			[Post-Chorus]<br>
			Your heart of ice<br>
			Your heart of i—<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			You got a heart of ice<br>
			I love the way you don&rsquo;t even try<br>
			To hide the fact that you were never mine<br>
			Oh my, I would&rsquo;ve never thought<br>
			Would&rsquo;ve never figured. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-heart-of-ice-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: BoyWithUke]<br>
			You were caught in a lie, said it with your eyes<br>
			Said to all my homies that you weren&rsquo;t even mine<br>
			You didn&rsquo;t think twice, got a heart made of ice<br>
			And that shit hit me, did me dirty<br>
			I never asked why, and I never did cry<br>
			I never told another how I felt inside<br>
			My demons don&rsquo;t hide when I&rsquo;m dreaming at night<br>
			And I won&rsquo;t mislead you, you&rsquo;ll miss me<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: BoyWithUke & blackbear]<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about you no more<br>
			Give me back my hoodies or I&rsquo;m kickin&rsquo; down doors<br>
			You weren&rsquo;t even pretty, lookin&rsquo; back and I&rsquo;m sure<br>
			You still miss me, that&rsquo;s so funny<br>
			I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about you, you swore<br>
			You would never talk about me before<br>
			You lied lookin&rsquo; filthy in your ugly jean shorts<br>
			You still kissed me, now shit&rsquo;s. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-idgaf-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "C">Contigo </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1: BoyWithUke]<br>
			Things weren&rsquo;t ever meant to end this way<br>
			I know I fucked it up enough, what can I say?<br>
			I&rsquo;m sorry, I can&rsquo;t seem to make you stay<br>
			I promise I won&rsquo;t put you through that pain<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: BoyWithUke]<br>
			I wanna be contigo but you&rsquo;re not in love with me so<br>
			All of this love turns me cold, enough to turn away<br>
			Yeah, I wanna be contigo more than I wanna be free<br>
			If that&rsquo;s okay, and I don&rsquo;t wanna make you go<br>
			But what more is there to chase?<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2: Powfu]<br>
			Contigo, what&rsquo;s that really mean, though?<br>
			Giving you attention every second buying Cheetos<br>
			Kilos, bragging to my mama and el chicos<br>
			No, this won&rsquo;t take one night (Duh, ayy)<br>
			I know it&rsquo;s all my fault for bouncing off the walls<br>
			I would say I&rsquo;m free, then I would miss your calls<br>
			Spending dumb. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-contigo-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "U">Understand </h2>
		<p>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Girl, I hope you understand, I wanted to hold your hand<br>
			But I can&rsquo;t, wanted to be your man back then<br>
			And you knew I fell for you, but you just broke my heart in two<br>
			I was sad, mad, and broken on my bed<br>
			Hoping I get rid of all the voices in my head<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I was opening a packet of an undeveloped med<br>
			When I was met with a prescription of a bullet made of lead<br>
			And when I woke up in an hour in a pool of my own sweat<br>
			I said, &ldquo;I swear to God I&rsquo;ll never even try to sleep again&rdquo;<br>
			So instead, I took my pen and started writing evidence<br>
			And when I started making sense, I found that I had reached the end<br>
			Oh, I&rsquo;m upset, I have no friends, you wanna bet, you&rsquo;re just pretend?<br>
			You&rsquo;re just a pet confined within the lines of writing, you&rsquo;re not shit<br>
			I thought I stopped my psychopathic ways, I swear I did<br>
			I said I&rsquo;d talk to people &rsquo;bout the problematic life I lived<br>
			They were my neighbors; razor blades<br>
			And different flavored pills I hit<br>

		<p>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Don&rsquo;t you tell me you&rsquo;re fine, I can tell when you&rsquo;re lying<br>
			Caught you slipping on ice but your heart is on fire<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I noticed your scars and I know that it&rsquo;s hard<br>
			And I hope you don&rsquo;t start getting all fucking quiet<br>
			&rsquo;Cause we made it so far, I don&rsquo;t wanna restart<br>
			Recollecting these sparks, reconnecting these wires<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m scared of the dark, can we skip to the part<br>
			Where you fall in my arms and you tell me you&rsquo;re tired?<br>
			<br>
			[Post-Chorus]<br>
			(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			You can tell me you&rsquo;re tired<br>
			(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Last night you looked quite alright<br>
			But you seem so formal all the time<br>
			&rsquo;Cause you laugh and smile<br>
			But you never cry, so why are you tired?<br>
			We go where we want to go<br>
			And we call. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-scared-of-the-dark-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "T">Toxic </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			All my friends are toxic, all ambitionless<br>
			So rude and always negative<br>
			I need new friends, but it&rsquo;s not that quick and easy<br>
			Oh, I&rsquo;m drowning, let me breathe<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I&rsquo;m better off all by myself<br>
			Though I&rsquo;m feeling kinda empty without somebody else<br>
			Oh, I hear you crying out for help<br>
			But you never showed for me when I was ringing your cell phone<br>
			Oh, you don&rsquo;t know how it feels to be alone<br>
			Baby, oh, I&rsquo;ll make you know, I&rsquo;ll make you know, oh<br>

			(Oh, I&rsquo;m drowning, let me breathe)<br>
			(I&rsquo;m drowning, let me breathe)<br>
			(Oh, I&rsquo;m drowning, let me breathe)<br>
			(I&rsquo;m drowning, let me breathe)<br>
