			[Intro]<br>
			There's a hundred miles from you and I<br>
			And so many signs to forget you<br>
			And though I might be wrong<br>
			And though I write shit songs<br>
			I know it won't be long 'til I see you<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Sorry, but I just can't stop liking you<br>
			I hope these other guys won't see you<br>
			Oh, so pretty like I do, please, don't break my heart<br>
			It's hard enough to heal arteries without glue<br>
			I'll see it through if you're down to<br>
			I'll see you soon 'cause I miss you<br>
			<br>
			[Verse]<br>
			I might go too high though, I'm typing all these typos<br>
			'Cause you're the sight I see when I'm falling off of my tightrope<br>
			And you're the life that flashes through my eyes when I will die<br>
			So I apologize, it's kinda hard for me to losе what I know<br>
			And I won't go too low. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-far-away-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Yeah, I can't do these long drives sittin' in the back seat<br>
			Thinkin' 'bout that one night when the world caught fire (You're driving me crazy)<br>
			Baby, and your eyes brightened up this dark scene<br>
			You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar (You're driving me crazy)<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			We just FaceTime, is this a sign? I'm fallin' out of your life<br>
			I try my hardest not to think about what I just realized<br>
			You said I was your light, I think that's just a white lie<br>
			Feelin' so rotten inside thought I died<br>
			I kinda wanna go back, I'm missin' the pain<br>
			Of a heartbreak and life just don't hit the same<br>
			I'm havin' migrainеs, my friends all over the placе<br>
			With their lifes straight, I guess I'm afraid<br>
			Of growin' out of my place<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			'Cause I can't do these long drives sittin' in the back seat<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Baby, let's pack our bags and head to wherever<br>
			Toss these plans out straight through the door<br>
			Won't you take my hand? It won't be forever<br>
			I don't have to be the one you're looking for<br>
			But I broke my foot, got lost on the mountain<br>
			Fucked my life again, but I'm sure<br>
			That you're not too far behind, so I'm counting<br>
			On you to stay when my heart is sore<br>
			Oh, hey, aye, I think I lost my way<br>
			Can you put me back in place? (Hahaha)<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I know you'd never let me down<br>
			But will you lift me off the ground?<br>
			Do you even know my name?<br>
			And even when I'm safe and sound<br>
			It could always turn around<br>
			But can you remember. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-let-me-down-lyrics">more</a>

			[Intro: BoyWithUke]<br>
			Ooh, alright, final take<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1: BoyWithUke]<br>
			Uh oh, what have you done?<br>
			Lock me up, I've fallen in love<br>
			Get me out of here, I said get me out of here<br>
			And I have homework and shit I need to do<br>
			Late assignments and papers overdue<br>
			I'm all out of tears, blurry nights won't disappear<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: BoyWithUke]<br>
			I was in my bed, I tried to sleep<br>
			I held my breath, I was too weak<br>
			I fell into your open arms<br>
			You'll break my heart, take it too far<br>
			But I don't care, this isn't fair<br>
			I love the way you do your hair<br>
			I love the way you write your name<br>
			I love thе way—<br>

			You're driving me crazy, you're driving mе mad<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Stood together outside, I don't even know what<br>
			Was going through my mind, now I think it was love<br>
			I never knew I could find someone who I thought was dumb<br>
			But made my heart go, "Ba-da-dum, ba-da-dum"<br>
			And I was so scared for my life, but I said that I would rather try<br>
			And I'm pretty sure I'm out of time (Hahaha)<br>
			And I throw my meds straight into the mud<br>
			'Cause it doesn't seem to help me when I'm falling in love<br>
			And my stomach hurts, but I don't mention the blood<br>
			I think I might need a doctor for the mess that I've become<br>
			Oh, I found it hard to breathe<br>
			It's getting dark out, don't you think?<br>
			Tell me or is it just me?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Then she took my coat 'cause it was cold<br>
			And we took pictures with her phone<br>
			She left her Polaroid at home<br>
			I texted all my friends I wrote that;<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I thought there was something wrong with my life<br>
			I thought I was hopeless, thinking I'm out of time<br>
			And nothing could change it and nobody knew<br>
			I thought I was breaking and then I met you<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Oh my, you're so fine, can't write you out my mind<br>
			I like it when you lie to me, I love it when you try to be<br>
			Wild, bitchy, impolite, somehow stuck in my sights<br>
			I like that you're not nice to me, I love your heart of ice<br>
			<br>
			[Post-Chorus]<br>
			Your heart of ice<br>
			Your heart of i—<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			You got a heart of ice<br>
			I love the way you don't even try<br>
			To hide the fact that you wеre never minе<br>
			Oh my, I would've never thought<br>
			Would've never figured. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-heart-of-ice-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: BoyWithUke]<br>
			You were caught in a lie, said it with your eyes<br>
			Said to all my homies that you weren't even mine<br>
			You didn't think twice, got a heart made of ice<br>
			And that shit hit me, did me dirty<br>
			I never asked why, and I never did cry<br>
			I never told another how I felt inside<br>
			My demons don't hide when I'm dreaming at night<br>
			And I won't mislead you, you'll miss me<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: BoyWithUke & blackbear]<br>
			'Cause I don't give a fuck about you no more<br>
			Give me back my hoodies or I'm kickin' down doors<br>
			You weren't even pretty, lookin' back and I'm sure<br>
			You still miss me, that's so funny<br>
			I don't give a fuck about you, you swore<br>
			You would never talk about me before<br>
			You lied lookin' filthy in your ugly jean shorts<br>
			You still kissed me, now shit's. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-idgaf-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: BoyWithUke]<br>
			Things weren't ever meant to end this way<br>
			I know I fucked it up enough, what can I say?<br>
			I'm sorry, I can't seem to make you stay<br>
			I promise I won't put you through that pain<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: BoyWithUke]<br>
			I wanna be contigo but you're not in love with me so<br>
			All of this love turns me cold, enough to turn away<br>
			Yeah, I wanna be contigo more than I wanna be free<br>
			If that's okay, and I don't wanna make you go<br>
			But what more is there to chase?<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2: Powfu]<br>
			Contigo, what's that really mean, though?<br>
			Giving you attention every second buying Cheetos<br>
			Kilos, bragging to my mama and el chicos<br>
			No, this won't take one night (Duh, ayy)<br>
			I know it's all my fault for bouncing off the walls<br>
			I would say I'm free, then I would miss your calls<br>

			[Chorus]<br>
			Girl, I hope you understand, I wanted to hold your hand<br>
			But I can't, wanted to be your man back then<br>
			And you knew I fell for you, but you just broke my heart in two<br>
			I was sad, mad, and broken on my bed<br>
			Hoping I get rid of all the voices in my head<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I was opening a packet of an undeveloped med<br>
			When I was met with a prescription of a bullet made of lead<br>
			And when I woke up in an hour in a pool of my own sweat<br>
			I said, "I swear to God I'll never even try to sleep again"<br>
			So instead, I took my pen and started writing evidence<br>
			And whеn I started making sense, I found that I had rеached the end<br>
			Oh, I'm upset, I have no friends, you wanna bet, you're just pretend?<br>
			You're just a pet confined within the lines of writing, you're not shit<br>
			I thought I stopped my psychopathic ways, I swear I did<br>
			I said I'd talk to people 'bout the problematic life I lived<br>
			They were my neighbors; razor blades<br>
			And different flavored pills I hit<br>
			Therefore, I'm at. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-understand-lyrics">more</a>

			[Chorus]<br>
			Don't you tell me you're fine, I can tell when you're lying<br>
			Caught you slipping on ice but your heart is on fire<br>
			'Cause I noticed your scars and I know that it's hard<br>
			And I hope you don't start getting all fucking quiet<br>
			'Cause we made it so far, I don't wanna restart<br>
			Recollecting these sparks, reconnecting these wires<br>
			'Cause I'm scared of the dark, can we skip to the part<br>
			Where you fall in my arms and you tell me you're tired?<br>
			<br>
			[Post-Chorus]<br>
			(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			You can tell me you're tired<br>
			(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Last night you looked quite alright<br>
			But you seem so formal all the time<br>
			'Cause you laugh and smile<br>
			But you never cry, so why are you tired?<br>
			We go where we want to go<br>
			And we call. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-scared-of-the-dark-lyrics">more</a>

		<h1 id = "T">Toxic </h1>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			All my friends are toxic, all ambitionless<br>
			So rude and always negative<br>
			I need new friends, but it's not that quick and easy<br>
			Oh, I'm drowning, let me breathe<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I'm better off all by myself<br>
			Though I'm feeling kinda empty without somebody else<br>
			Oh, I hear you crying out for help<br>
			But you never showed for me when I was ringing your cell phone<br>
			Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone<br>
			Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh<br>

			But life is immaculate, backin' it up a bit<br>
