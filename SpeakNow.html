			[Intro]<br>
			Oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
			Oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
			
			[Verse 1]<br>
			You were in college working part time waitin&rsquo; tables<br>
			Left a small town, never looked back<br>
			I was a flight risk with a fear of falling<br>
			Wonderin&rsquo; why we bother with love if it never lasts<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I say, &ldquo;Can you believe it?&rdquo;<br>
			As we&rsquo;re lyin&rsquo; on the couch<br>
			The moment I could see it<br>
			Yes, yes, I can see it now<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Do you remember, we were sittin&rsquo; there by the water?<br>
			You put your arm around me for the first time<br>
			You made a rebel. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-mine-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "SF">Sparks Fly </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and I&rsquo;m a house of cards<br>
			You&rsquo;re the kind of reckless that should send me runnin&rsquo;<br>
			But I kinda know that I won&rsquo;t get far<br>
			And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch<br>
			Close enough to hope you couldn&rsquo;t see what I was thinkin&rsquo; of<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain<br>
			Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile<br>
			Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down<br>
			Give me something that&rsquo;ll haunt me when you&rsquo;re not around<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			My mind forgets to remind me you&rsquo;re a bad idea<br>
			You touch me once. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-sparks-fly-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "BTD">Back To December </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I&rsquo;m so glad you made time to see me<br>
			How&rsquo;s life? Tell me, how&rsquo;s your family?<br>
			I haven&rsquo;t seen them in a while<br>
			You&rsquo;ve been good, busier than ever<br>
			We small talk, work and the weather<br>
			Your guard is up and I know why<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Because the last time you saw me<br>
			Is still burned in the back of your mind<br>
			You gave me roses and I left them there to die<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			So, this is me swallowing my pride<br>
			Standing in front of you saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for that night&rdquo;<br>
			And I go back. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-back-to-december-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "SN">Speak Now </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I am not the kind of girl<br>
			Who should be rudely bargin&rsquo; in on a white veil occasion<br>
			But you are not the kind of boy<br>
			Who should be marrying the wrong girl<br>
			I sneak in and see your friends<br>
			And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel<br>
			And she is yelling at a bridesmaid<br>
			Somewhere back inside a room<br>
			Wearin&rsquo; a gown shaped like a pastry<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			This is surely not what you thought it would be<br>
			I lose myself in a daydream<br>
			Where I stand and say. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-speak-now-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "DJ">Dear John </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Long were the nights when<br>
			My days once revolved around you<br>
			Counting my footsteps<br>
			Praying the floor won&rsquo;t fall through again<br>
			And my mother accused me of losing my mind<br>
			But I swore I was fine<br>
			You paint me a blue sky<br>
			Then go back and turn it to rain<br>
			And I lived in your chess game<br>
			But you changed the rules everyday<br>
			Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight<br>
			Well, I stopped pickin&rsquo; up and this song is to let you know why<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Dear John, I see it all now that you&rsquo;re gone<br>
			Don&rsquo;t you think I was too young to be messed with?<br>
			The girl in the dress cried the whole way home<br>
			I should&rsquo;ve known. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-dear-john-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "Me">Mean </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			You, with your words like knives<br>
			And swords and weapons that you use against me<br>
			You have knocked me off my feet again<br>
			Got me feeling like I&rsquo;m nothing<br>
			You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard<br>
			Calling me out when I&rsquo;m wounded<br>
			You, pickin&rsquo; on the weaker man<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Well, you can take me down<br>
			With just one single blow<br>
			But you don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Someday, I&rsquo;ll be livin&rsquo; in a big old city<br>
			And all you&rsquo;re ever gonna be is mean<br>
			Someday, I&rsquo;ll be. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-mean-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "TSOU">The Story Of Us </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I used to think one day, we&rsquo;d tell the story of us<br>
			How we met and the sparks flew instantly<br>
			And people would say, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the lucky ones&rdquo;<br>
			I used to know my place was the spot next to you<br>
			Now, I&rsquo;m searching the room for an empty seat<br>
			&rsquo;Cause lately, I don&rsquo;t even know what page you&rsquo;re on<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Oh, a simple complication<br>
			Miscommunications lead to fallout<br>
			So many things that I wish you knew<br>
			So many walls up, I can&rsquo;t break through<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Now, I&rsquo;m standing alone in a crowded room<br>
			And we&rsquo;re not speaking<br>
			And I&rsquo;m dying to. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-the-story-of-us-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "NGU">Never Grow Up </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Your little hand&rsquo;s wrapped around my finger<br>
			And it&rsquo;s so quiet in the world tonight<br>
			Your little eyelids flutter &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re dreaming<br>
			So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight<br>
			To you, everything&rsquo;s funny<br>
			You got nothing to regret<br>
			I&rsquo;d give all I have, honey<br>
			If you could stay like that<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Oh, darling, don&rsquo;t you ever grow up<br>
			Don&rsquo;t you ever grow up, just stay this little<br>
			Oh, darling, don&rsquo;t you ever grow up<br>
			Don&rsquo;t you ever grow up, it could stay this simple<br>
			I won&rsquo;t let nobody hurt you<br>
			Won&rsquo;t let no one break your heart<br>
			And no one. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-never-grow-up-lyrics">more</a>
		</p>
		<h2 id = "E">Enchanted </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			There I was again tonight<br>
			Forcing laughter, faking smiles<br>
			Same old tired, lonely place<br>
			Walls of insincerity<br>
			Shifting eyes and vacancy<br>
			Vanished when I saw your face<br>
			All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Your eyes whispered, &ldquo;Have we met?&rdquo;<br>
			Across the room, your silhouette<br>
			Starts to make its way to me<br>
			The playful conversation starts<br>
			Counter all your quick remarks. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-enchanted-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "BTR">Better Than Revenge </h2>
		<p>
			[Intro]<br>
			Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did<br>
			Ha, time for a little revenge<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and<br>
			I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him<br>
			She came along, got him alone, and let&rsquo;s hear the applause<br>
			She took him faster than you can say &ldquo;Sabotage&rdquo;<br>
			I never saw it coming, wouldn&rsquo;t have suspected it<br>
			I underestimated just who I was dealing with<br>
			She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum<br>
			She underestimated just who she was stealing from<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			She&rsquo;s not a saint and she&rsquo;s not what you think<br>
			She&rsquo;s an actress, woah<br>
			She&rsquo;s better known. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-better-than-revenge-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "I">Innocent </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I guess you really did it this time<br>
			Left yourself in your war path<br>
			Lost your balance on a tightrope<br>
			Lost your mind trying to get it back<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Wasn&rsquo;t it easier in your lunchbox days?<br>
			Always a bigger bed to crawl into<br>
			Wasn&rsquo;t it beautiful when you believed in everything<br>
			And everybody believed in you?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			It&rsquo;s alright, just wait and see<br>
			Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh<br>
			Who you are is not where you&rsquo;ve been<br>
			You&rsquo;re still an innocent<br>
			You&rsquo;re still an innocent. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-innocent-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "H">Haunted </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			You and I walk a fragile line<br>
			I have known it all this time<br>
			But I never thought I&rsquo;d live to see it break<br>
			It&rsquo;s getting dark and it&rsquo;s all too quiet<br>
			And I can&rsquo;t trust anything now<br>
			And it&rsquo;s coming over you like it&rsquo;s all a big mistake<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Woah, holding my breath<br>
			Won&rsquo;t lose you again<br>
			Something&rsquo;s made your eyes go cold<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Come on, come on, don&rsquo;t leave me like this<br>
			I thought I had you figured out<br>
			Something&rsquo;s gone terribly wrong<br>
			You&rsquo;re all I wanted. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-haunted-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "LK">Last Kiss </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I still remember the look on your face<br>
			Lit through the darkness at 1:58<br>
			The words that you whispered for just us to know<br>
			You told me you loved me<br>
			So why did you go away?<br>
			Away<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			I do recall now, the smell of the rain<br>
			Fresh on the pavement<br>
			I ran off the plane<br>
			That July ninth, the beat of your heart<br>
			It jumps through your shirt<br>
			I can still feel your arms<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			But now I&rsquo;ll go<br>
			Sit on the floor. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-last-kiss-lyrics">more</a>
		</p>
		<h2 id = "LL">Long Live </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I said, &ldquo;Remember this moment&rdquo;<br>
			In the back of my mind<br>
			The time we stood with our shaking hands<br>
			The crowds in stands went wild<br>
			We were the kings and the queens<br>
			And they read off our names<br>
			The night you danced like you knew our lives would<br>
			Never be the same<br>
			You held your head like a hero on a history book page<br>
			It was the end of a decade<br>
			But the start of an age<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
			How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
			I was screaming, &ldquo;Long live all the magic we made&rdquo;<br>
			And bring on all the pretenders. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-long-live-lyrics">more</a>
