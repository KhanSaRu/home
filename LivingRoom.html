			[Verse 1: Jack]<br>
			Was it all in my head?<br>
			In an empty bed<br>
			And I told you that I need you<br>
			Baby, can't you see I'm alone?<br>
			Oh, oh<br>
			I was lost in my feet<br>
			On an empty street<br>
			So I save your seat, infinity<br>
			Forever figures 5 and 3<br>
			You know, oh oh<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus 1: Ryan]<br>
			Cross my heart and hope to die<br>
			Stick a needle in my eye<br>
			My mama says to pick the best<br>
			And you are it<br>

			You're feeling good, you're feeling right<br>
			Across the floor, and I'm already losing my mind<br>
			Baby girl, looking fine<br>
			Watch you playing and playing and playing these guys<br>
			Catch my stare, little smile<br>
			Tell me that you're ready and you're feeling the vibe<br>
			Someday I'll be so damn sublime<br>
			We'll arrive behind a hashtag sign<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			Oh father, father, I'm a dreamer (a dreamer)<br>
			We dream of green, but now we're gray<br>
			Up on a hill, down by the river<br>
			That river took my girl away<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			And I wonder, is something in the water make me wanting more?<br>
			Make me wanting more<br>
			A heartbreak and a hundred red balloons<br>

			So here I go<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I'm up and I raise my cup singing everything is gold<br>
			Crew neck and a white blank check<br>
			I'll be moving on my own<br>
			I walked on sippin' on on that love<br>
			It's another bumpy road<br>
			But I'm up and I raise my cup and I wanna take her home<br>

			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I run my mouth<br>
			Don't got a lot to say<br>
			Girl on fire<br>
			Could burn my heart away<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I didn't know her, couldn't hold her<br>
			Bones didn't settle in<br>
			She's gotta have it, gotta have it<br>
			Oh, with her hipster friends<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Oh oh, she's the rough and the rowdiest kid<br>
			Oh oh, and there's more where she lives<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And why should I spend time running for my life?<br>
			And when the skies are open, we'll still be singing this<br>
			I know they're coming for me, we're not the pitchfork kids<br>
			Oh oh, it's the loneliest life that we live<br>

			Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen<br>
			Finally, I'm right where I should be<br>
			Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot<br>
			You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops<br>
			You know<br>
			Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen<br>
			Oh-oh-oh<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1: Ryan]<br>
			Called you up so we could reminisce<br>
			About the old days, gold days, how we've been<br>
			The city's rusty after what we did<br>
			We did, we did, we did<br>

			[Pre-Chorus: All]<br>
			Hey, and though I know it's been a long time in the records<br>

			Now we're livin' on love<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			You said marriage has a nice ring to it<br>
			And my jaw dropped down like the kick drum knew it<br>
			I can't stop and let you go<br>
			Baby, I gotta mind to let you know<br>
			I'm not one to take it fast<br>
			I got the best seat back in history class<br>
			One last chance to make it real<br>
			Baby, I wanna tell you how I feel<br>

			Sayin' you<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			The world is a marble heart<br>
			Too fragile, too broken<br>
			Left without nothing but our bags to hold on to<br>
			Yeah out in the daylight<br>
			And out of the jungle<br>
			We could have been, we should have been<br>
			What your heart couldn't handle<br>

			Feel like I need, to forget you<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			A year from now, we won't be pretty<br>
			A year from now, we won't be young<br>
			But we will live among the giants<br>
			Before the giants learn to run<br>

			Now we are the blessed<br>
			Now we are the strong<br>
			Take my hand, and let me know<br>
			That it feels good<br>
			To feel at home<br>

			We would sail across the ocean<br>
			If cloudy skies should take our friends<br>

			Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea<br>

			[Verse 1: Ryan]<br>
			I've seen almost every side of the industry<br>
			Except the side we've been working seven years to see<br>
			Just some kids with pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea<br>
			(But no IDs)<br>
			So bar scenes weren't an option<br>
			Ukulele DJs, only band in the genre<br>
			And we're dreaming of Bahamas<br>
			So pass around the bottle<br>
			Good music's still good even if no one is watching<br>

			Now you're on top of the world tonight<br>
			You can do anything you'd like<br>

			No point in crying without that someone there beside you<br>
			Saying it will be okay<br>

			I'll take my time<br>
			I'll take my time<br>
			You cannot rush<br>
			What can’t be timed<br>
			And it's tough believing<br>
			There's someone living out there<br>
