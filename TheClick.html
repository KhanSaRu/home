			Have I done my best here, or<br>
			Will I be here next year, or<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			"No thank you" is what I should've said<br>
			I should be in bed<br>
			But temptations of trouble on my tongue<br>
			Troubles yet to come<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			One sip, bad for me<br>
			One hit, bad for me<br>
			One kiss, bad for me<br>
			But I give in so easily<br>
			And "no thank you" is how it should've gone<br>
			I should stay strong<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?<br>
			Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that<br>
			I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?<br>

			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			Hello, hello<br>
			I'm not where I'm supposed to be<br>
			I hope that you're missin' me<br>
			'Cause it makes me feel young<br>
			Hello, hello<br>
			Last time that I saw your face<br>
			Was recess in second grade<br>
			And it made me feel young<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			Won't you help me sober up?<br>
			Growin' up, it made me numb<br>
			And I wanna feel somethin' again<br>
			Won't you help me sober up?<br>
			All the big kids, they got drunk<br>
			And I want to feel somethin' again (Oh oh oh oh)<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			When did all my friends become so loud?<br>
			We act like reality shows<br>
			Probably 'cause reality blows<br>
			When did all my friends become so loud?<br>
			We traded our boring lives<br>
			For MTV story lines<br>
			Why?<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			Recently he said, that she said, that we said some shit that you wouldn't believe<br>
			Recently he said that she said that we said that he said some shit about me<br>

			[Chorus: Jack Met, All]<br>
			So we're caught up in drama<br>
			Everybody's talking, everybody's talking<br>
			We're caught up in problems<br>
			Everybody's talking, everybody's talking, ooh ahh<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			I hold you<br>
			I hold you closer than I ever knew<br>
			I could do<br>
			But I'm confused<br>
			I thought I'd recognize when love was true<br>
			But I'm confused<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			Am I ready for love?<br>
			Or maybe just a best friend<br>
			Should there be a difference?<br>
			Do you have instructions?<br>
			Maybe I'm stuck on what I see on TV<br>
			I grew up on Disney<br>
			But this don't feel like Disney<br>

			You say I turned out fine<br>

		<p>
			[Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			Oh, I didn’t smoke no grass today<br>
			But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage<br>
			So who am I to take away<br>
			What makes you feel this great<br>
			I didn’t smoke no grass today<br>
			But that’s because I love to play<br>
			So who am I to take away<br>
			What makes you feel this great<br>

			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			Does the grass look greener (Greener)<br>
			On my side of the speakers (Speakers)<br>
			I tried a couple weekends<br>
			But that green’s not for me<br>
			I thought I’d get clever<br>
			Make my lyrics come out better<br>
			But at 7/11’s where you would find me<br>

			Don’t wanna get paranoid<br>
			Just wanna be making noise<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			Never spoken with my mouth full<br>
			Yeah that's a mouthful and I'm doubtful<br>
			That I could get these lyrics out, oh<br>
			'Cause I think fast but I sing slow<br>
			If I ever started rapping<br>
			They'd be laughing, they won't believe me<br>
			But I got so much I wanna say<br>
			So I'm thinking rappers, they got it easy<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2: Jack Met]<br>
			Someone told me to be selfless<br>
			But we are helpless without attention<br>
			So if no one's paying attention<br>
			Then does my voice get to your headphones?<br>
			You start thinking 'bout the clock ticks<br>
			You get nervous, you start stressin'<br>
			So how am I supposed to fit this<br>
			In three minutes and thirty seconds<br>

			Listen to my aching heart<br>

			Oh my God, what's going on?<br>
			This night got fuckin' weird<br>
			Drove so fast my brain got buzzed<br>
			And now I'm standin' here<br>
			Met so many faces that<br>
			Will probably forget me<br>
			Boy, I bet I look so grown up<br>
			Shirt tucked in my jeans<br>

			And now after it all, I just really wanna call<br>

			[Verse 2: Ryan Met]<br>
			We went dancing on the roof<br>
			And took some girls uptown<br>
			They started fighting with my friend<br>
			And I can't find him now<br>
			Hit some bars, and saw some brawls<br>

			You've never heard of me<br>
			Or the weird shit I do and say<br>
			That's my favorite thing<br>
			That I'm not famous, no<br>
			And I'm never on TV<br>
			Throwing up on an LA street<br>
			Nobody judges me<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: Ryan Met]<br>
			I had my first crush in season two<br>
			She passed me notes and filled our hands with glue<br>
			And in my corduroys, we'd walk to school<br>
			I sat and crossed my legs like Jim would do<br>
			She moved away, I was on season three<br>
			It hit my heart so hard, I'd hardly speak<br>
			But I could find some peace and privacy<br>
			A paper company to sit with me<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			Who are we to wonder where we're going?<br>
			Who am I to tell me who I am?<br>
			Let's take it back and take in every moment<br>
			Who am I to tell me who I am?<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2: Ryan Met]<br>
			I turned down Jameson when I was twelve<br>
			I spent that Friday night with Steve Carell<br>
			The one where Dwight became the head of sales<br>
			My eighth-grade graduation wished me well<br>
			I lost my grandpa during season six<br>
			I watched my mom, she. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-netflix-trip-lyrics">more</a>

			Way up, way up, way up to the moon<br>
			Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Enough, enough, there's no celebrities here<br>
			So why's the bouncer taking everything so seriously?<br>
			It's you and I, it's cool you feel the same<br>
			Like why's the DJ here if he's just pressing play?<br>

			Kickin' in the basement, kickin' in the basement<br>
			Hatin' all the same things too<br>

			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			I can't complain, no I won't be mourning<br>
			'Cause I skipped on prom for Elvis Duran in the Morning<br>
			All of my life I have been starving<br>
			Not for a dinner with friends, more of a starving artist<br>
