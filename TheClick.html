			Have I done my best here, or<br>

			One sip, bad for me<br>
			One hit, bad for me<br>
			One kiss, bad for me<br>

			Hello, hello<br>
			I&rsquo;m not where I&rsquo;m supposed to be<br>
			I hope that you&rsquo;re missin&rsquo; me<br>
			&rsquo;Cause it makes me feel young<br>
			Hello, hello<br>
			Last time that I saw your face<br>
			Was recess in second grade<br>
			And it made me feel young<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			Won&rsquo;t you help me sober up?<br>
			Growin&rsquo; up, it made me numb<br>
			And I wanna feel somethin&rsquo; again<br>
			Won&rsquo;t you help me sober up?<br>
			All the big kids, they got drunk<br>
			And I want to feel somethin&rsquo; again (Oh oh oh oh)<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			When did all my friends become so loud?<br>
			We act like reality shows<br>
			Probably &rsquo;cause reality blows<br>
			When did all my friends become so loud?<br>
			We traded our boring lives<br>
			For MTV story lines<br>
			Why?<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			Recently he said, that she said, that we said some shit that you wouldn&rsquo;t believe<br>
			Recently he said that she said that we said that he said some shit about me<br>

			[Chorus: Jack Met, All]<br>
			So we&rsquo;re caught up in drama<br>
			Everybody&rsquo;s talking, everybody&rsquo;s talking<br>
			We&rsquo;re caught up in problems<br>
			Everybody&rsquo;s talking, everybody&rsquo;s talking, ooh ahh<br>

			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			I hold you<br>
			I hold you closer than I ever knew<br>
			I could do<br>
			But I&rsquo;m confused<br>
			I thought I&rsquo;d recognize when love was true<br>
			But I&rsquo;m confused<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			Am I ready for love?<br>
			Or maybe just a best friend<br>
			Should there be a difference?<br>
			Do you have instructions?<br>
			Maybe I&rsquo;m stuck on what I see on TV<br>
			I grew up on Disney<br>
			But this don&rsquo;t feel like Disney<br>

			You say I turned out fine<br>

		<p>
			[Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			Oh, I didn’t smoke no grass today<br>
			But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage<br>
			So who am I to take away<br>
			What makes you feel this great<br>
			I didn’t smoke no grass today<br>
			But that’s because I love to play<br>
			So who am I to take away<br>
			What makes you feel this great<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			Does the grass look greener (Greener)<br>
			On my side of the speakers (Speakers)<br>
			I tried a couple weekends<br>
			But that green’s not for me<br>
			I thought I’d get clever<br>
			Make my lyrics come out better<br>
			But at 7/11’s where you would find me<br>

			Don’t wanna get paranoid<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			Never spoken with my mouth full<br>
			Yeah that&rsquo;s a mouthful and I&rsquo;m doubtful<br>
			That I could get these lyrics out, oh<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I think fast but I sing slow<br>
			If I ever started rapping<br>
			They&rsquo;d be laughing, they won&rsquo;t believe me<br>
			But I got so much I wanna say<br>
			So I&rsquo;m thinking rappers, they got it easy<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2: Jack Met]<br>
			Someone told me to be selfless<br>
			But we are helpless without attention<br>
			So if no one&rsquo;s paying attention<br>
			Then does my voice get to your headphones?<br>
			You start thinking &rsquo;bout the clock ticks<br>
			You get nervous, you start stressin&rsquo;<br>
			So how am I supposed to fit this<br>
			In three minutes and thirty seconds<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			Listen to my aching heart<br>
			Quick, before you skip the song<br>

			[Verse 1: Ryan Met]<br>
			Oh my God, what&rsquo;s going on?<br>
			This night got fuckin&rsquo; weird<br>
			Drove so fast my brain got buzzed<br>
			And now I&rsquo;m standin&rsquo; here<br>
			Met so many faces that<br>
			Will probably forget me<br>
			Boy, I bet I look so grown up<br>
			Shirt tucked in my jeans<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Ryan Met]<br>
			And now after it all, I just really wanna call<br>

			My dad<br>
			I feel so broke up, I wanna go home<br>
			No, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home<br>

			[Verse 2: Ryan Met]<br>
			We went dancing on the roof<br>
			And took some girls uptown<br>
			They started fighting with my friend<br>
			And I can&rsquo;t find him now<br>
			Hit some bars, and saw some brawls<br>

			I don&rsquo;t got one, I&rsquo;m not famous, no<br>
			And I don&rsquo;t hate it, no<br>

			You&rsquo;ve never heard of me<br>
			Or the weird shit I do and say<br>
			That&rsquo;s my favorite thing<br>
			That I&rsquo;m not famous, no<br>
			And I&rsquo;m never on TV<br>
			Throwing up on an LA street<br>
			Nobody judges me<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: Ryan Met]<br>
			I had my first crush in season two<br>
			She passed me notes and filled our hands with glue<br>
			And in my corduroys, we&rsquo;d walk to school<br>
			I sat and crossed my legs like Jim would do<br>
			She moved away, I was on season three<br>
			It hit my heart so hard, I&rsquo;d hardly speak<br>
			But I could find some peace and privacy<br>
			A paper company to sit with me<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Jack Met]<br>
			Who are we to wonder where we&rsquo;re going?<br>
			Who am I to tell me who I am?<br>
			Let&rsquo;s take it back and take in every moment<br>
			Who am I to tell me who I am?<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2: Ryan Met]<br>
			I turned down Jameson when I was twelve<br>
			I spent that Friday night with Steve Carell<br>
			The one where Dwight became the head of sales<br>
			My eighth-grade graduation wished me well<br>
			I lost my grandpa during season six<br>
			I watched my mom, she. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-netflix-trip-lyrics">more</a>

			Boy, it&rsquo;s good to know I got a bud like you<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Enough, enough, there&rsquo;s no celebrities here<br>
			So why&rsquo;s the bouncer taking everything so seriously?<br>
			It&rsquo;s you and I, it&rsquo;s cool you feel the same<br>
			Like why&rsquo;s the DJ here if he&rsquo;s just pressing play?<br>

			I can&rsquo;t complain, no I won&rsquo;t be mourning<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I skipped on prom for Elvis Duran in the Morning<br>
