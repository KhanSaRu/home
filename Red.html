			[Verse 1]<br>
			I&rsquo;m walking fast through the traffic lights<br>
			Busy streets and busy lives<br>
			And all we know is touch and go<br>
			We are alone with our changing minds<br>
			We fall in love &rsquo;til it hurts or bleeds<br>
			Or fades in time<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And I never (Never)<br>
			Saw you coming<br>
			And I’ll never (Never)<br>
			Be the same<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			You come around and the armor falls<br>
			Pierce the room like a cannonball<br>
			Now, all we know is don’t let go<br>
			We are alone, just you and me<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street<br>
			Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly<br>
			Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you&rsquo;re already flying through the free fall<br>
			Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Losing him was blue like I&rsquo;d never known<br>
			Missing him was dark gray, all alone<br>
			Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you&rsquo;ve never met<br>
			But loving him was red<br>
			<br>

			(Red, red)<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Put your lips close to mine<br>
			As long as they don&rsquo;t touch<br>
			Out of focus, eye to eye<br>
			&rsquo;Til the gravity&rsquo;s too much<br>
			And I&rsquo;ll do anything you say<br>
			If you say it with your hands<br>
			And I&rsquo;d be smart to walk away<br>
			But you&rsquo;re quicksand<br>

			This slope is treacherous<br>
			This path is reckless<br>
			This slope is treacherous<br>
			And I-I-I like it<br>

			[Intro]<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago<br>
			I was in your sights, you got me alone<br>
			You found me, you found me<br>
			You found me-e-e-e-e<br>
			I guess you didn&rsquo;t care, and I guess I liked that<br>
			And when I fell hard, you took a step back<br>
			Without me, without me<br>
			Without me-e-e-e-e<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			And he&rsquo;s long gone when he&rsquo;s next to me<br>
			And I realize the blame is on me<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
			So shame on me now<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I walked through the door with you, the air was cold<br>
			But something &rsquo;bout it felt like home somehow<br>
			And I left my scarf there at your sister&rsquo;s house<br>
			And you&rsquo;ve still got it in your drawer, even now<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze<br>
			We&rsquo;re singing in the car, getting lost upstate<br>
			Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place<br>
			And I can picture it after all these days<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			And I know it&rsquo;s long gone and<br>
			That magic&rsquo;s not here no more<br>
			And I might be okay, but I&rsquo;m not fine at all<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			It feels like a perfect night<br>
			To dress up like hipsters<br>
			And make fun of our exes<br>
			Uh-uh, uh-uh<br>
			It feels like a perfect night<br>
			For breakfast at midnight<br>
			To fall in love with strangers<br>
			Uh-uh, uh-uh<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Yeah<br>
			We&rsquo;re happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time<br>
			It&rsquo;s miserable and magical, oh, yeah<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I bet this time of night, you’re still up<br>
			I bet you’re tired from a long hard week<br>
			I bet you’re sittin&rsquo; in your chair by the window<br>
			Looking out at the city, and I bet<br>
			Sometimes, you wonder &rsquo;bout me<br>
			<br>

			And I just wanna tell you<br>
			It takes everything in me not to call you<br>
			And I wish I could run to you<br>
			And I hope you know that<br>
			Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			I bet you think I either moved on or hate you<br>
			‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply<br>
			I bet it never, ever occurred to you<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I remember when we broke up the first time<br>
			Saying, &ldquo;This is it, I&rsquo;ve had enough,&rdquo; &rsquo;cause like<br>
			We hadn&rsquo;t seen each other in a month<br>
			When you said you needed space (What?)<br>
			Then you come around again and say<br>
			&ldquo;Baby, I miss you and I swear I&rsquo;m gonna change, trust me&rdquo;<br>
			Remember how that lasted for a day?<br>
			I say, &ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; we break up, you call me, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;<br>

			Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I&rsquo;m pretty sure we almost broke up last night<br>
			I threw my phone across the room, at you<br>
			I was expecting some dramatic turn away<br>
			But you stayed<br>
			This morning, I said we should talk about it<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved<br>
			That&rsquo;s when you came in wearing a football helmet<br>
			And said, &ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s talk&rdquo;<br>
			And I said<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Stay, stay, stay<br>
			I&rsquo;ve been loving you for quite some time, time, time<br>
			You think that it&rsquo;s funny when I&rsquo;m mad, mad, mad<br>
			But I think that it&rsquo;s best if we both stay<br>

			[Verse 1: Gary]<br>
			Find myself at your door<br>
			Just like all those times before<br>
			I’m not sure how I got there<br>
			All roads, they lead me here<br>
			I imagine you are home<br>
			In your room, all alone<br>
			And you open your eyes into mine<br>
			And everything feels better<br>

			And right before your eyes<br>
			I&rsquo;m breaking, no past<br>
			No reasons why<br>
			Just you and me<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I was reminiscing just the other day<br>
			While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away<br>
			Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time<br>
			Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme<br>
			Took off faster than a green light, go<br>
			Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know<br>
			I left a note on the door with a joke we&rsquo;d made<br>
			And that was the first day<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And darling, it was good<br>
			Never looking down<br>
			And right there where we stood<br>
			Was holy ground<br>

			Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress<br>
			We had this big wide city all to ourselves<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Long handwritten note deep in your pocket<br>
			Words, how little they mean when you&rsquo;re a little too late<br>
			I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket<br>
			Good girls, hopeful they&rsquo;ll be and long they will wait<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			We had a beautiful magic love there<br>
			What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation<br>
			We both wake in lonely beds, different cities<br>
			And time is taking its sweet time erasing you<br>
			And you&rsquo;ve got your demons, and darling, they all look like me<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			New to town with a made-up name<br>
			In the angel&rsquo;s city, chasing fortune and fame<br>
			And the camera flashes make it look like a dream<br>
			You had it figured out since you were in school<br>
			Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool<br>
			So overnight, you look like a sixties queen<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus 1]<br>
			Another name goes up in lights<br>
			Like diamonds in the sky<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus 1]<br>
			And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one<br>

			Know something now I didn&rsquo;t before<br>

			I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of &rsquo;45<br>
			Picked me up, late one night out the window<br>
			We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild<br>

			The night we snuck into a yacht club party<br>
			Pretending to be a duchess and a prince<br>

			I walked in, expecting you&rsquo;d be late<br>
			But you got here early and you stand and wave<br>
