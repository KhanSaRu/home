		<p>I have multiple musical artists that I really like. Presently I'have been obsessed with paramore. This 
		band is only one of the many other	artists I like. The list includes Taylor Swift, Masie Peters, StrayKids, 
		BoyWithUke and many more. There is one artist that I love more than	the rest. They are StrayKids. Even 
		though they are a kpop band with music mostly in the Korean language, I relate a lot to their lyrics.</p>
