			[Verse 1]
			Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow<br>
			Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats<br>
			Everybody here wanted something more<br>
			Searching for a sound we hadn&rsquo;t heard before<br>
			And it said<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Welcome to New York, it&rsquo;s been waiting for you<br>
			Welcome to New York, welcome to New York<br>
			Welcome to New York, it&rsquo;s been waiting for you<br>
			Welcome to New York, welcome to New York<br>
			It&rsquo;s a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore<br>
			The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me<br>

			Nice to meet you, where you been?<br>
			I could show you incredible things<br>
			Magic, madness, heaven, sin<br>
			Saw you there and I thought<br>
			&ldquo;Oh, my God, look at that face<br>
			You look like my next mistake<br>
			Love&rsquo;s a game, wanna play?&rdquo; Ayy<br>
			New money, suit and tie<br>

			Ain&rsquo;t it funny? Rumors fly<br>
			And I know you heard about me<br>
			So, hey, let&rsquo;s be friends<br>
			I&rsquo;m dying to see how this one ends<br>

			We were lying on your couch<br>
			I remember<br>
			You took a Polaroid of us<br>
			Then discovered (Then discovered)<br>
			The rest of the world was black and white<br>
