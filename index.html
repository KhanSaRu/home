		<p id = "Top">I have multiple musical artists that I really like. My list of favourite artists is almost as long as I am
		tall. So as not to bore everyone with all the silly details I will choose to only talk about my top five. My very favourite
		artist, or artists, I should say is a band called Stray Kids. They are a kpop band but their music and lyrics captivate
		me. Next on the list is Taylor Swift who is a solo american singer. Then there are two other soloists on my list. BoyWithUke
		and Tessa Violet in third and forth respectively. Lastly on the last spot on my top five is AJR, a family band that has 
		been active for a really long time.</p>
		<h1>Artists</h1>
		<h2>Taylor Swift</h2>

		<p>Taylor Alison Swift is an American Singer-Songwriter that is very passionate about what she does. She has been singing since
		she was a child. She learned to play the guiter when she was 12 from unlikely teachers like the computer repairman. Although
		her creative streak started earlier than that at the age of nine. She has been writing and performing since she was 13. All 
		this led Taylor Swift to her much earned fame today.</p>

		discography.</a>To name every single one of her songs would be unreasonable. Instead I will talk about her albums. Do keep in
		mind that there are also multiple versions of these albums. In my website I chose to only mention the original versions. All
		of Taylor Swifts albums have meanings behind them. In each page I will mention the overall feel and meaning of each album. </p>

		<h2>BouWithUke</h2>
		<h3>General Information</h3>
		<p>There isn't much personal information on BoyWithUke since he is an anonymous online singer. The most that is known about
		him is his age, birthday, and the city he lives in(Boston, Massachusetts). He chooses to keep his identity hidden so that his recognition comes
		from his musical talent and not his looks. An interesting fact known about him is that he was forced into classical music
		when he was younger (which can lead to some speculations about his family background). Although he dropped it and persued 
		a different genre of music in highschool.</p>

				productions, arrangements and lyrics for Stray Kids. 3RACHA is led by Bangchan who is also the leader of Stray
				Kids as a whole.</p>
				<p>1. Bang Chan</p>
				<p>2. Changbin</p>
				<p>3. HAN</p>
			</li>
			<li>

				<p>They were created after Stray Kids gained recognition. They are a unit focused on dance as could be guessed
				from their name. The three members of this unit have amazing control over their body which makes them very skilled.
				Their debut as a unit happened in 2020 as part of an act for their album. The group is let by Lee Know, the main
				dancer of Stray Kids.</p>

				<p>3. Felix</p>
			</li>
			<li>

				ninth member of Stray Kids left the band in 2020. Therefore by the time of VocalRACHA's debut in 2020 they has to
				be a to member team. The two members have the best voice in the whole band. They are also the youngest members of 
				the band as a whole which makes them a cute unit.</p>
				<p>2. Seungmin</p>
				<p>1. I.N.</p>

		<h2>AJR</h2>
		<h3>General Information</h3>
		<p>A simple but interesting thing to note about the name of the band relates to the names of the members. The band name
		&lsquo;AJR&rsquo; comes from the first names of the three members. Something else to look for in the names of the 
		members are their last names. The same last name might indicate to people that the members might be siblings. You would
		be correct if you though this. This small indie band started a very long time ago in the streets of New York. They
		would busk in the streets for hours, and now they are a billboard famous band to look up to. </p>
