			Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him<br>
			Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted<br>
			But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom<br>
			Holdin' him for ransom, some<br>
			Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though<br>
			Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so<br>
			I see nothing better, I keep him forever<br>

			This ain't for the best<br>

			You must like me for me<br>
			We can't make<br>
			Any promises now, can we, babe?<br>
			But you can make me a drink<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?<br>
			Phone lights up my nightstand in the black<br>
			Come here, you can meet me in the back<br>

			Oh, damn, never seen that color blue<br>
			Just think of the fun things we could do<br>

			I don't like your little games<br>
			Don't like your tilted stage<br>
			The role you made me play<br>
			Of the fool, no, I don't like you<br>
			I don't like your perfect crime<br>

			You said the gun was mine<br>
			Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)<br>

			But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			See you in the dark<br>
			All eyes on you, my magician<br>
			All eyes on us<br>
			You make everyone disappear, and<br>
			Cut me into pieces<br>
			Gold cage, hostage to my feelings<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			You should take it as a compliment<br>
			That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk<br>
			You should think about the consequence<br>
			Of your magnetic field being a little too strong<br>
			And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us<br>

			[Intro]<br>
			No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			It was the best of times, the worst of crimes<br>
			I struck a match and blew your mind<br>
			But I didn't mean it and you didn’t see it<br>
			The ties were black, the lies were white<br>
			In shades of gray in candlelight<br>
			I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason<br>

			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			"X" marks the spot where we fell apart<br>
			He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself<br>
			I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
			We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)<br>

			I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own<br>

			We met a few weeks ago<br>
			Now you try on callin' me "baby" like tryin' on clothes<br>

			Salute to me, I'm your American queen<br>
			And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat<br>

			Oh, twenty-five years old<br>
			Oh, how were you to know? And<br>
			My, my love had been frozen<br>
			Deep blue, but you painted me golden<br>
			Oh, and you held me close<br>
			Oh, how was I to know? I–<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets<br>
			Picture of your face in an invisible locket<br>
			You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it<br>
			I had a bad feeling<br>
			And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis<br>
			People started talking, putting us through our paces<br>
			I knew there was no one in the world who could take it<br>
			I had a bad feeling<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But we were dancing<br>

			All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation<br>
			My hands are shaking from holding back from you<br>
