			Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him<br>
			Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted<br>
			But if he&rsquo;s a ghost, then I can be a phantom<br>
			Holdin&rsquo; him for ransom, some<br>
			Some boys are tryin&rsquo; too hard, he don&rsquo;t try at all though<br>
			Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so<br>
			I see nothing better, I keep him forever<br>
			Like a vendetta-ta<br>

			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I, I, I see how this is gon&rsquo; go<br>

			[Intro]<br>
			This ain&rsquo;t for the best<br>
			My reputation&rsquo;s never been worse, so<br>
			You must like me for me<br>
			We can&rsquo;t make<br>
			Any promises now, can we, babe?<br>
			But you can make me a drink<br>

			Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?<br>

			Come here, you can meet me in the back<br>
			Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you<br>
			Oh, damn, never seen that color blue<br>
			Just think of the fun things we could do<br>

			The role you made me play<br>
			Of the fool, no, I don&rsquo;t like you<br>

			All eyes on us<br>
			You make everyone disappear, and<br>
			Cut me into pieces<br>
			Gold cage, hostage to my feelings<br>
			Back against the wall<br>
			Trippin&rsquo;, trip-trippin&rsquo; when you&rsquo;re gone<br>

			Gorgeous<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			You should take it as a compliment<br>
			That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk<br>
			You should think about the consequence<br>
			Of your magnetic field being a little too strong<br>
			And I got a boyfriend, he&rsquo;s older than us<br>

			[Intro]<br>
			No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			It was the best of times, the worst of crimes<br>
			I struck a match and blew your mind<br>
			But I didn&rsquo;t mean it and you didn’t see it<br>
			The ties were black, the lies were white<br>
			In shades of gray in candlelight<br>
			I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			"X" marks the spot where we fell apart<br>
			He poisoned the well, I was lyin&rsquo; to myself<br>
			I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
			We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I&rsquo;m perfectly fine, I live on my own<br>
			I made up my mind, I&rsquo;m better off bein&rsquo; alone<br>
			We met a few weeks ago<br>
			Now you try on callin&rsquo; me "baby" like tryin&rsquo; on clothes<br>

			Salute to me, I&rsquo;m your American queen<br>
			And you move to me like I&rsquo;m a Motown beat<br>
			And we rule the kingdom inside my room<br>
			&rsquo;Cause all the boys and their expensive cars<br>
			With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars<br>
			Never took me quite where you do<br>

			And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for<br>

			First sight, yeah, we love without reason<br>
			Oh, twenty-five years old<br>
			Oh, how were you to know? And<br>
			My, my love had been frozen<br>
			Deep blue, but you painted me golden<br>
			Oh, and you held me close<br>
			Oh, how was I to know? I–<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Could&rsquo;ve spent forever with your hands in my pockets<br>
			Picture of your face in an invisible locket<br>
			You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it<br>
			I had a bad feeling<br>
			And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis<br>
			People started talking, putting us through our paces<br>
			I knew there was no one in the world who could take it<br>
			I had a bad feeling<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But we were dancing<br>
			Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>

			Our secret moments in a crowded room<br>
			They got no idea about me and you<br>
			There is an indentation in the shape of you<br>
			Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation<br>
			My hands are shaking from holding back from you<br>

			My hands are shaking from all this<br>

			And there are no rules when you show up here<br>
			Bass beat rattling the chandelier<br>
