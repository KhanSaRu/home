			[Verse 1]<br>
			He said the way my blue eyes shined<br>
			Put those Georgia stars to shame that night<br>
			I said, "That&rsquo;s a lie"<br>
			Just a boy in a Chevy truck<br>
			That had a tendency of gettin&rsquo; stuck<br>
			On backroads at night<br>
			And I was right there beside him all summer long<br>
			And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone<br>
			&nbsp; <br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But when you think Tim McGraw<br>
			I hope you think my favorite song<br>
			The one we danced to all night long<br>
			The moon like a spotlight on the lake<br>
			When you think happiness<br>
			I hope you think that little black dress<br>
			Think of my head on your chest<br>
			And my old faded blue jeans<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy<br>
			I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me<br>
			So, go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy<br>
			That's fine, you won't mind if I say<br>
			By the way<br>
			&nbsp; <br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive<br>
			You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'<br>
			So, watch me strike a match on all my wasted time<br>
			As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn<br>
			&nbsp; <br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge<br>
			There's nothing stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends<br>
			And if you come around sayin' sorry to me<br>

			I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I don't know what I want, so don't ask me<br>
			Cause I'm still trying to figure it out<br>
			Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking<br>
			Trying to see through the rain coming down<br>
			Even though I'm not the only one<br>
			Who feels the way I do<br>
			&nbsp; <br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know<br>
			I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on<br>
			Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world<br>
			&nbsp; <br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Got the radio on, my old blue jeans<br>
			And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve<br>
			I'm feeling lucky today, got the sunshine<br>
			Could you tell me what more do I need<br>
			And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			You have a way of coming easily to me<br>
			And when you take, you take the very best of me<br>
			So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something<br>
			And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day<br>
			Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say<br>
			And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through<br>
			I've never been anywhere cold as you<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray<br>
			And I stood there loving you and wished them all away<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I didn't know what I would find<br>
			When I went looking for a reason, I know<br>
			I didn't read between the lines<br>
			And, baby, I've got nowhere to go<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I tried to take the road less traveled by<br>
			But nothing seems to work the first few times<br>
			Am I right?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			So how can I ever try to be better?<br>
			Nobody ever lets me in<br>
			I can still see you, this ain't the best view<br>
			On the outside looking in<br>
			I've been a lot of lonely places<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]v
			Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty<br>
			Is the face in the mirror looking back at you<br>
			You walk around here thinking you're not pretty<br>
			But that's not true<br>
			'Cause I know you<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Hold on, baby, you're losing it<br>
			The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go<br>
			And no one knows<br>
			That you cry, but you don't tell anyone<br>
			That you might not be the golden one<br>
			And you're tied together with a smile<br>
			But you're coming undone, oh<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			I guess it's true that love was all you wanted<br>
			'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change<br>
			Hoping it will end up in his pocket (Pocket)<br>
			But he leaves you. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-tied-together-with-a-smile-lyrics">more</a>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Corey's eyes are like a jungle<br>
			He smiles, it's like the radio<br>
			He whispers songs into my window<br>
			In words that nobody knows<br>
			There's pretty girls on every corner<br>
			They watch him as he's walking home<br>
			Saying, "Does he know?"<br>
			Will you ever know?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			You're beautiful, every little piece, love<br>
			Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?<br>
			Ask anyone<br>
			And when you find everything you looked for<br>
			I hope your life leads you back to my door<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			It's strange to think the songs we used to sing<br>
			The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone<br>
			Yesterday, I found out about you<br>
			Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			You say that you'd take it all back<br>
			Given one chance<br>
			It was a moment of weakness<br>
			And you said yes<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			You should've said no, you should've gone home<br>
			You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go<br>
			You should've known that word<br>
			'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)<br>
			And I should've been there, in the back of your mind<br>
			I shouldn't be asking myself why<br>
			You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet<br>
			You should've said no<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			She said I was seven and you were nine<br>
			I looked at you like the stars that shined<br>
			In the sky, the pretty lights<br>
			And our daddies used to joke about the two of us<br>
			Growing up and falling in love<br>
			And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes<br>
			And said, "Oh, my, my, my"<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Take me back to the house in the backyard tree<br>
			Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me<br>
			You never did, you never did<br>
			Take me back when our world was one block wide<br>
			I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried<br>
			Just two kids, you and I<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone<br>
			In the front seat of his car<br>
			He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel<br>
			The other on my heart<br>
			I look around, turn the radio down<br>
			He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"<br>
			I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin'<br>
			How we don't have a song"<br>
			And he says<br>
<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Our song is the slamming screen door<br>
			Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window<br>
			When we're on the phone and you talk real slow<br>
			'Cause it's late and your mama don't know<br>
			Our song is the way you laugh<br>
			The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			Friday night beneath the stars<br>
			In a field behind your yard<br>
			You and I are painting pictures in the sky<br>
			And sometimes, we don't say a thing<br>
			Just listen to the crickets sing<br>
			Everything I need is right here by my side<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			And I know everything about you<br>
			I don't wanna live without you<br>
			<br>

			I'm only up when you're not down<br>
			Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground<br>
			It's like no matter what I do<br>
			Well, you drive me crazy half the time<br>
			The other half, I'm only tryin' to<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			She can't see the way your eyes<br>
			Light up when you smile<br>
			She'll never notice how you stop and stare<br>
			Whenever she walks by

			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her<br>
			But you are everything to me<br>

			And I just wanna show you<br>
			She don't even know you<br>
