		[Intro]
These are our drums
This is our melody
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Now listen closely as our drums become our melody
And here's our song
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
So let me play my violin for you (Bang, bang, bang)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
So let me play my violin for you
The truth is that I'm screwed
Still, Joe, do you think. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-ok-overture-lyrics">more</a>

		[Chorus]
Bummerland
Here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland
Give a cheer
'Cause you're only going up from here

[Verse 1]
This month
I got seven haircuts
And now my hair is all gone
It's sad but
I've been alone for too long
So I keep getting haircuts

[Pre-Chorus]
It's my all time low
And I just can't wait
'Cause the quicker I'm. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-bummerland-lyrics">more</a>

		[Intro: Jack Met & The Beu Sisters]
Come on, guy
I promise everything'll be alright, be okay
Your eyes are tired, but keep 'em open
'Cause you wouldn't want to miss a thing
Come on, guy
I promise everything'll be alright, be okay
Your eyes are tired, but keep 'em open
'Cause you wouldn't wanna miss a thing

[Verse 1: Jack Met]
It's kinda funny how I paid for college
When YouTube was an option
But then I would've had to spend
My best years
Skipping ads and readin' comments
And when the hell did advertisements get so good?
They're like narcotics
So now I'm spendin' every penny I own
I should have allotted to. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-3-oclock-things-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]
I put on a play in my old house
In my cape, jumpin' on the old couch
Puttin' up lights when it's cold out
Mom and Dad, both seats sold out
Show you my play

[Verse 2]
Haven't seen the old house lately
Wonder if they found my spaceship
I don't want my own love wasted
Tell me this is what you're sayin'

[Pre-Chorus]
If you both outgrew one another
I could start now, lookin' for a lover
But if love dies, do I fuckin' bother?

[Chorus]
I just really, really, really. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-my-play-lyrics">more</a>

		[Intro]
I believed in God back in eight grade
He could smoke an eighth on a school day
Remember when you laughed at my last name?
Now I go by Met, is that less lame of a last name?

[Verse 1]
I believed in God back in '09
Always down to hang, he had no time
Yeah, but in a couple of years, I'll be so outta here
I'll have a lotta new friends and I won't even care

[Chorus]
I don't ever think of you 
I got too much stuff to do
Should have left you back in school
Joseph, do you think I'm
I don't ever think of you 
Look at all this stuff I do. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-joe-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]
I keep losing my socks
Where the hell do they go?
I bet they're finally free
Floating somewhere in the sea
Do they miss my feet?
I keep losing my socks
I got nothing to wear
I bet they're at her place
A house where I can't show my face
How I wanna be there

[Chorus]
Holy moly, it's a real do-nothing day
I could change address and try another state
I could change my name, it won't do anything
Adventure is out there (Adventure is out there)
So why am I in hеre. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-adventure-is-out-there-lyrics">more</a>

		<h1 id = "B">Bang! </h1>
		<p>
		[Verse 1]
I get up, I get down
And I'm jumpin' around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge
Still, I'm not feeling grown
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go!)

[Chorus]
So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody
Come hang (Come hang)
Let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-bang-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]
I got a dog and my dog can dance
Just not in public and not with my friends
I got a girl and she's twenty-eight
Now I'm the coolest guy in all of eighth grade
I know a kid that you've never met
His dad is a rock star, we smoked in his van
I know a trick, do you wanna see?
I can be anything that I pretend to be

[Chorus]
We'll get out of this, we'll get out of this too
I'm not proud of this, but I'm not proud of the truth
And if you run from me
Then I'll use my trick on you
The truth is that I'm screwed

[Verse 2]
I went to France and danced in the rain

		<p>
		[Intro]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Your happy friends call you depressing
'Cause you wonder why we’re all alive
Your downer friends think you're too happy, too happy
'Cause you still celebrate sometimes

Your hippie friends call you a sellout
’Cause you buckle down and get a job
You still get high but you're no hippie, no hippie
But all your work friends think you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess the last time you had any fun
Was way back when you weren't anyone

[Chorus]
So goodbye, ordinaryish people. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-ordinaryish-people-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Chorus]
Humpty Dumpty, when Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one's around"
(Okay)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Okay)

[Verse 1]
Something's wrong
But I'm scared to look it up
If I do that and no one has it
I'll feel so alone
Something's wrong
But don't pity me for long
If you get sad, then I'll feel bad
That I told you at all. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-humpty-dumpty-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]
My grandpa fought in World War II
He was such a noble dude
I can't even finish school
Missed my mom and left too soon
His dad was a fireman
Who fought fires so violent
I think I bored my therapist
While playing him my violin

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh my god) That's so insane
(Oh my god) That's such a shame
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad
I kinda feel like two things can be sad (One, two, three, four)

The world's smallest violin
Really needs an. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-worlds-smallest-violin-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]
I should move
'Cause New York is getting muddy out
There's LA
But it's always kinda sunny out
And I don't wanna hurt no more
So I set my bar real low

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling

[Chorus]
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-way-less-sad-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Intro]
Ok, I'm ready

[Verse 1]
New Year's Eve
I was at a festival in New Orleans
You were in Tribeca kissing nobody
I owe you one, yes, I do
Valentine's Day
We decided we would do the whole damn thing
But I played to an empty gym at Iowa State
I guess I owe you that too

[Pre-Chorus]
I try so hard to be so happy, are you happy too?
Doo, doo, doo, doo

[Chorus]
Plan on this
You're no longer gonna. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-christmas-in-june-lyrics">more</a>
