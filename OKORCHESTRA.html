			Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah<br>
			Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			So let me play my violin for you (Bang, bang, bang)<br>
			Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah<br>

			Bummerland<br>
			Here I am<br>
			Better nix my summer plans<br>
			Bummerland<br>
			Give a cheer<br>
			&rsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re only going up from here<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			This month<br>
			I got seven haircuts<br>
			And now my hair is all gone<br>
			It&rsquo;s sad but<br>
			I&rsquo;ve been alone for too long<br>
			So I keep getting haircuts<br>

			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			It&rsquo;s my all time low<br>
			And I just can&rsquo;t wait<br>

			[Intro: Jack Met & The Beu Sisters]<br>
			Come on, guy<br>
			I promise everything&rsquo;ll be alright, be okay<br>
			Your eyes are tired, but keep &rsquo;em open<br>
			&rsquo;Cause you wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss a thing<br>
			Come on, guy<br>
			I promise everything&rsquo;ll be alright, be okay<br>
			Your eyes are tired, but keep &rsquo;em open<br>
			&rsquo;Cause you wouldn&rsquo;t wanna miss a thing<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1: Jack Met]<br>
			It&rsquo;s kinda funny how I paid for college<br>
			When YouTube was an option<br>
			But then I would&rsquo;ve had to spend<br>
			My best years<br>
			Skipping ads and readin&rsquo; comments<br>
			And when the hell did advertisements get so good?<br>
			They&rsquo;re like narcotics<br>
			So now I&rsquo;m spendin&rsquo; every penny I own<br>
			I should have allotted to. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-3-oclock-things-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I put on a play in my old house<br>
			In my cape, jumpin&rsquo; on the old couch<br>
			Puttin&rsquo; up lights when it&rsquo;s cold out<br>
			Mom and Dad, both seats sold out<br>
			Show you my play<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Haven&rsquo;t seen the old house lately<br>
			Wonder if they found my spaceship<br>
			I don&rsquo;t want my own love wasted<br>
			Tell me this is what you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo;<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			If you both outgrew one another<br>
			I could start now, lookin&rsquo; for a lover<br>
			But if love dies, do I fuckin&rsquo; bother?<br>

		<p>
			[Intro]<br>
			I believed in God back in eight grade<br>
			He could smoke an eighth on a school day<br>
			Remember when you laughed at my last name?<br>
			Now I go by Met, is that less lame of a last name?<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I believed in God back in &rsquo;09<br>
			Always down to hang, he had no time<br>
			Yeah, but in a couple of years, I&rsquo;ll be so outta here<br>
			I&rsquo;ll have a lotta new friends and I won&rsquo;t even care<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I don&rsquo;t ever think of you <br>
			I got too much stuff to do<br>
			Should have left you back in school<br>
			Joseph, do you think I&rsquo;m<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I keep losing my socks<br>
			Where the hell do they go?<br>
			I bet they&rsquo;re finally free<br>
			Floating somewhere in the sea<br>
			Do they miss my feet?<br>
			I keep losing my socks<br>
			I got nothing to wear<br>
			I bet they&rsquo;re at her place<br>
			A house where I can&rsquo;t show my face<br>
			How I wanna be there<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Holy moly, it&rsquo;s a real do-nothing day<br>
			I could change address and try another state<br>
			I could change my name, it won&rsquo;t do anything<br>
			Adventure is out there (Adventure is out there)<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I get up, I get down<br>
			And I&rsquo;m jumpin&rsquo; around<br>
			And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now<br>
			Been a hell of a ride<br>
			But I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s time to grow<br>
			Bang! Bang! Bang!<br>
			So I got an apartment across from the park<br>
			Put quinoa in my fridge<br>
			Still, I&rsquo;m not feeling grown<br>
			Been a hell of a ride<br>
			But I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s time to go<br>
			Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go!)<br>

			So put your best face on everybody<br>
			Pretend you know this song everybody<br>

		<h2 id = "TT">The Trick </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I got a dog and my dog can dance<br>
			Just not in public and not with my friends<br>
			I got a girl and she&rsquo;s twenty-eight<br>
			Now I&rsquo;m the coolest guy in all of eighth grade<br>
			I know a kid that you&rsquo;ve never met<br>
			His dad is a rock star, we smoked in his van<br>
			I know a trick, do you wanna see?<br>
			I can be anything that I pretend to be<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			We&rsquo;ll get out of this, we&rsquo;ll get out of this too<br>
			I&rsquo;m not proud of this, but I&rsquo;m not proud of the truth<br>
			And if you run from me<br>
			Then I&rsquo;ll use my trick on you<br>
			The truth is that I&rsquo;m screwed<br>

		<p>
			[Intro]<br>
			Ooh, ooh<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Your happy friends call you depressing<br>
			&rsquo;Cause you wonder why we’re all alive<br>
			Your downer friends think you&rsquo;re too happy, too happy<br>
			&rsquo;Cause you still celebrate sometimes<br>
			<br>
			Your hippie friends call you a sellout<br>
			’Cause you buckle down and get a job<br>
			You still get high but you&rsquo;re no hippie, no hippie<br>
			But all your work friends think you are<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I guess the last time you had any fun<br>
			Was way back when you weren&rsquo;t anyone<br>

			[Chorus]<br>
			Humpty Dumpty, when Humpty Dumpty<br>
			When Humpty Dumpty went down<br>
			He said, &ldquo;Screw it, I&rsquo;ma smile right through it<br>
			And I&rsquo;ll scream when no one&rsquo;s around&rdquo;<br>
			(Okay)<br>
			(Hey, hey)<br>
			(Hey, hey)<br>
			(Okay)<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Something&rsquo;s wrong<br>
			But I&rsquo;m scared to look it up<br>
			If I do that and no one has it<br>
			I&rsquo;ll feel so alone<br>
			Something&rsquo;s wrong<br>
			But don&rsquo;t pity me for long<br>
			If you get sad, then I&rsquo;ll feel bad<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			My grandpa fought in World War II<br>
			He was such a noble dude<br>
			I can&rsquo;t even finish school<br>
			Missed my mom and left too soon<br>
			His dad was a fireman<br>
			Who fought fires so violent<br>
			I think I bored my therapist<br>
			While playing him my violin<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			(Oh my god) That&rsquo;s so insane<br>
			(Oh my god) That&rsquo;s such a shame<br>
			Next to them, my shit don&rsquo;t feel so grand<br>
			But I can&rsquo;t help myself from feeling bad<br>
			I kinda feel like two things can be sad (One, two, three, four)<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I should move<br>
			&rsquo;Cause New York is getting muddy out<br>
			There&rsquo;s LA<br>
			But it&rsquo;s always kinda sunny out<br>
			And I don&rsquo;t wanna hurt no more<br>
			So I set my bar real low<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I&rsquo;m a-okay, I&rsquo;m a-okay<br>
			You say it but you just don&rsquo;t mean it<br>
			You&rsquo;re so insane, you&rsquo;re so insane<br>
			Shut up and just enjoy this feeling<br>

			[Chorus]<br>
			Don&rsquo;t you love it? Don&rsquo;t you love it?<br>
			No, I ain&rsquo;t happy yet, but I&rsquo;m way less sad<br>

			You were in Tribeca kissing nobody<br>
			I owe you one, yes, I do<br>
