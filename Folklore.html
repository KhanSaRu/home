			[Verse 1]<br>
			I&rsquo;m doing good, I&rsquo;m on some new shit<br>
			Been saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;no&rdquo;<br>
			I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn&rsquo;t though<br>
			I hit the ground running each night<br>
			I hit the Sunday matinée<br>
			You know the greatest films of all time were never made<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I guess you never know, never know<br>
			And if you wanted me, you really should&rsquo;ve showed<br>
			And if you never bleed, you&rsquo;re never gonna grow<br>
			And it&rsquo;s alright now<br>
			<br>

		<h2 id = "C">Cardigan </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Vintage tee, brand new phone<br>
			High heels on cobblestones<br>
			When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
			Sequin smile, black lipstick<br>
			Sensual politics<br>
			When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But I knew you<br>
			Dancin&rsquo; in your Levi&rsquo;s<br>
			Drunk under a streetlight, I<br>
			I knew you<br>
			Hand under my sweatshirt<br>
			Baby, kiss it better, I. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-cardigan-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "TLGAD">The Last Great American Dynasty </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny<br>
			Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis<br>
			Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money<br>
			And the town said, &ldquo;How did a middle-class divorcée do it?&rdquo;<br>
			The wedding was charming, if a little gauche<br>
			There&rsquo;s only so far new money goes<br>
			They picked out a home and called it &ldquo;Holiday House&rdquo;<br>
			Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud<br>
			The doctor had told him to settle down<br>
			It must have been her fault his heart gave out<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And they said<br>
			&ldquo;There goes the last great American dynasty<br>
			Who knows, if she never showed up, what could&rsquo;ve been<br>
			There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen<br>
			She had a marvelous time. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-the-last-great-american-dynasty-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "E">Exile </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]<br>
			I can see you standing, honey<br>
			With his arms around your body<br>
			Laughin&rsquo;, but the joke&rsquo;s not funny at all<br>
			And it took you five whole minutes<br>
			To pack us up and leave me with it<br>
			Holdin&rsquo; all this love out here in the hall<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Justin Vernon]<br>
			I think I&rsquo;ve seen this film before<br>
			And I didn&rsquo;t like the ending<br>
			You&rsquo;re not my homeland anymore<br>
			So what am I defending now?<br>
			You were my town, now I&rsquo;m in exile, seein&rsquo; you out<br>
			I think I&rsquo;ve seen this film before<br>
			<br>

		<h2 id = "MTR">My Tears Ricochet </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			We gather here, we line up, weepin&rsquo; in a sunlit room<br>
			And if I&rsquo;m on fire, you&rsquo;ll be made of ashes, too<br>
			Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe<br>
			All the hell you gave me?<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you<br>
			&rsquo;Til my dying day<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I didn&rsquo;t have it in myself to go with grace<br>
			And you&rsquo;re the hero flying around, saving face<br>
			And if I&rsquo;m dead to you, why are you at the wake?<br>
			Cursing my name, wishing I stayed<br>
			Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			We gather stones, never knowing what they&rsquo;ll mean<br>
			Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring<br>
			You know I didn&rsquo;t want to have to haunt you<br>
			But what a ghostly scene<br>
			You wear the same. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-my-tears-ricochet-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "M">Mirrorball </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I want you to know<br>
			I&rsquo;m a mirrorball<br>
			I&rsquo;ll show you every version of yourself tonight<br>
			I&rsquo;ll get you out on the floor<br>
			Shimmering beautiful<br>
			And when I break, it&rsquo;s in a million pieces<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Hush, when no one is around, my dear<br>
			You&rsquo;ll find me on my tallest tiptoes<br>
			Spinning in my highest heels, love<br>
			Shining just for you<br>
			Hush, I know they said the end is near<br>
			But I&rsquo;m still on my tallest tiptoes<br>
			Spinning in my highest heels, love<br>
			Shining just for you<br>

		<h2 id = "S">Seven </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Please picture me in the trees<br>
			I hit my peak at seven<br>
			Feet in the swing over the creek<br>
			I was too scared to jump in<br>
			But I, I was high in the sky<br>
			With Pennsylvania under me<br>
			Are there still beautiful things?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Sweet tea in the summer<br>
			Cross your heart, won&rsquo;t tell no other<br>
			And though I can’t recall your face<br>
			I still got love for you<br>
			Your braids like a pattern<br>
			Love you to the Moon and to Saturn<br>
			Passed down like folk songs<br>
			The love lasts so long<br>
			<br>
			[Bridge]<br>
			And I&rsquo;ve been meaning to tell you<br>
			I think your house is haunted<br>
			Your dad is. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-seven-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "A">August </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Salt air, and the rust on your door<br>
			I never needed anything more<br>
			Whispers of &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;<br>
			&ldquo;Never have I ever before&rdquo;<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But I can see us lost in the memory<br>
			August slipped away into a moment in time<br>
			&rsquo;Cause it was never mine<br>
			And I can see us twisted in bedsheets<br>
			August sipped away like a bottle of wine<br>
			&rsquo;Cause you were never mine<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Your back beneath the sun<br>
			Wishin&rsquo; I could write my name on it<br>
			Will you call when you&rsquo;re back at school?<br>

		<h2 id = "TIMT">This Is Me Trying </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I&rsquo;ve been having a hard time adjusting<br>
			I had the shiniest wheels, now they&rsquo;re rusting<br>
			I didn&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d care if I came back<br>
			I have a lot of regrets about that<br>
			Pulled the car off the road to the lookout<br>
			Could&rsquo;ve followed my fears all the way down<br>
			And maybe I don&rsquo;t quite know what to say<br>
			But I&rsquo;m here in your doorway<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I just wanted you to know that this is me trying<br>
			I just wanted you to know that this is me trying<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			They told me all of my cages were mental<br>
			So I got wasted like all my potential<br>
			And my words shoot to kill when I&rsquo;m mad<br>
			I have a lot of regrets about that<br>
			I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere<br>
			Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here<br>
			Pouring out my heart to a stranger<br>
			But I didn&rsquo;t pour. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-this-is-me-trying-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "IA">Illicit Affairs </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Make sure nobody sees you leave<br>
			Hood over your head, keep your eyes down<br>
			Tell your friends you&rsquo;re out for a run<br>
			You’ll be flushed when you return<br>
			Take the road less traveled by<br>
			Tell yourself you can always stop<br>
			What started in beautiful rooms<br>
			Ends with meetings in parking lots<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And that&rsquo;s the thing about illicit affairs<br>
			And clandestine meetings and longing stares<br>
			It&rsquo;s born from just one single glance<br>
			But it dies and it dies and it dies<br>
			A million little times<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Leave the perfume on the shelf<br>
			That you picked out just for him<br>
			So you leave no trace behind<br>
			Like you don’t. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-illicit-affairs-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "IS">Invisible String </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Green was the color of the grass<br>
			Where I used to read at Centennial Park<br>
			I used to think I would meet somebody there<br>
			Teal was the color of your shirt<br>
			When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop<br>
			You used to work at to make a little money<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Time, curious time<br>
			Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs<br>
			Were there clues I didn&rsquo;t see?<br>
			And isn&rsquo;t it just so pretty to think<br>
			All along there was some<br>
			Invisible string<br>
			Tying you to me?<br>
			Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Bad was the blood of the song in the cab<br>
			On your first trip to LA<br>
			You ate at my. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-invisible-string-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "MW">Mad Woman </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			What did you think I&rsquo;d say to that?<br>
			Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?<br>
			They strike to kill, and you know I will<br>
			You know I will<br>
			What do you sing on your drive home?<br>
			Do you see my face in the neighbor&rsquo;s lawn?<br>
			Does she smile?<br>
			Or does she mouth, &ldquo;Fuck you forever&rdquo;?<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy<br>
			What about that?<br>
			And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And there&rsquo;s nothing like a mad woman<br>
			What a shame she went mad<br>
			No one likes a mad woman<br>
			You made her like that<br>
			And you&rsquo;ll poke that bear &rsquo;til her claws come out<br>
			And you find something to wrap your noose around<br>
			And there&rsquo;s. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-mad-woman-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Keep your helmet, keep your life, son<br>
			Just a flesh wound, here&rsquo;s your rifle<br>
			Crawling up the beaches now<br>
			&ldquo;Sir, I think he&rsquo;s bleeding out&rdquo;<br>
			And some things you just can&rsquo;t speak about<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			With you I serve, with you I fall down, down<br>
			Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out<br>

			[Verse 2]<br>
			Something med school did not cover<br>
			Someone&rsquo;s daughter, someone&rsquo;s mother<br>
			Holds your hand through plastic now<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			Betty, I won&rsquo;t make assumptions<br>
			About why you switched your homeroom, but<br>
			I think it&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause of me<br>
			Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard<br>
			When I passed your house<br>
			It&rsquo;s like I couldn&rsquo;t breathe<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			You heard the rumors from Inez<br>
			You can&rsquo;t believe a word she says<br>
			Most times, but this time it was true<br>
			The worst thing that I ever did<br>
			Was what I did to you<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But if I just showed up at your party<br>
			Would you have me? Would you want me?<br>
			Would you tell me to go fuck myself<br>
			Or lead me to the garden?<br>
			In the garden. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-betty-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "P">Peace </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Our coming-of-age has come and gone<br>
			Suddenly this summer, it&rsquo;s clear<br>
			I never had the courage of my convictions<br>
			As long as danger is near<br>
			And it&rsquo;s just around the corner, darlin&rsquo;<br>
			&rsquo;Cause it lives in me<br>
			No, I could never give you peace<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But I&rsquo;m a fire and I&rsquo;ll keep your brittle heart warm<br>
			If your cascade, ocean wave blues come<br>
			All these people think love&rsquo;s for show<br>
			But I would die for you in secret<br>
			The devil&rsquo;s in the details, but you got a friend in me<br>
			Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Your integrity makes me seem small<br>
			You paint dreamscapes on the wall<br>
			I talk shit with my friends, it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m wasting your honor<br>
			And you know that I&rsquo;d swing with you for the fences<br>
			Sit with you. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-peace-lyrics">more</a>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			My only one<br>
			My smoking gun<br>
			My eclipsed sun<br>
			This has broken me down<br>
			My twisted knife<br>
			My sleepless night<br>
			My winless fight<br>
			This has frozen my ground<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Stood on the cliffside screaming, &ldquo;Give me a reason&rdquo;<br>
			Your faithless love&rsquo;s the only hoax I believe in<br>
			Don&rsquo;t want no other shade of blue but you<br>
			No other sadness in the world would do<br>

			[Verse 2]<br>
			My best laid plan<br>
			Your sleight of hand<br>
			My barren land<br>
