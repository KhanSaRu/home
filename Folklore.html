			[Verse 1]
I&rsquo;m doing good, I&rsquo;m on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn&rsquo;t though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should&rsquo;ve showed
And if you never bleed, you&rsquo;re never gonna grow
And it&rsquo;s alright now

[Chorus]
But we were. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-the-1-lyrics">more</a>

		<h1 id = "C">Cardigan </h1>
			<p>
			[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin&rsquo; in your Levi&rsquo;s
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-cardigan-lyrics">more</a>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There&rsquo;s only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could&rsquo;ve been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-the-last-great-american-dynasty-lyrics">more</a>
