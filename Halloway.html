			[Verse 1]<br>
			Would you be embarrassed<br>
			Think I&rsquo;m being careless<br>
			If I said you&rsquo;re all I want and more?<br>
			Finger tips and collarbones<br>
			If I caught you on your own<br>
			Would you mind my hand stitched into yours?<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus 1]<br>
			I got it bad, bad, oh<br>
			I see you in my sleep<br>
			And I want you mad, madly<br>
			Come running after me<br>
			You&rsquo;re in my bones, bones<br>
			Oh, I gotta let you go<br>
			But I don&rsquo;t know how when<br>
			You&rsquo;re rooted in my soul<br>
			Oh, oh<br>
			I gotta tell you. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Tessa-violet-dream-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "NOY">Not Over You </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			You call me up<br>
			Say that you&rsquo;ve been busy<br>
			But something made you just reach out<br>
			And we meet up<br>
			Tell each other stories<br>
			&rsquo;bout how we been since we last talked<br>
			Our coffee date<br>
			Moves into the evening<br>
			We wonder how it got so late<br>
			We walk around<br>
			And I keep asking how<br>
			I don&rsquo;t know better by now<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			(oo-oo-oo-ah)<br>
			You try but you can&rsquo;t shake me<br>
			I think we&rsquo;re. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Tessa-violet-not-over-you-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "H">Haze </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I used to be<br>
			Overwhelmed by every little thing<br>
			Torn apart, unraveled at the seams<br>
			I think it rooted in the way I breathe, mm<br>
			And I get drunk<br>
			On a boy who asks me if I&rsquo;m up<br>
			Tells me he can&rsquo;t understand his luck<br>
			To know me, to love me<br>
			To hold me, show up<br>
			I&rsquo;ll be your empathetic savior<br>
			Call me up, I&rsquo;ll meet you later<br>
			You can praise me for the way<br>
			I always know just what to say<br>
			I&rsquo;ll carve into your ribs<br>
			And leave you crying for a kiss<br>
			Just for kicks<br>
			Hmm. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Tessa-violet-haze-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "OMO">On My Own </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I put my foot in my mouth again<br>
			I hope they still want to be my friends<br>
			I got desirable qualities<br>
			If you don&rsquo;t mind my obsessing with me<br>
			I kept repeating myself yesterday<br>
			Repeating myself I keep on yesterday<br>
			I want a people that I can call home<br>
			But why do the work when I&rsquo;m doing just fine all on my own?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Ohh-oh, ohh-oh<br>
			And I don&rsquo;t mind being alone<br>
			Ohh-oh, ohh-oh<br>
			I&rsquo;m doing fine. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Tessa-violet-on-my-own-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "IDGTSILYA">I Don&rsquo;t Get To Say I Love You Anymore </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I drive a new path so I won&rsquo;t have to pass the place where you first held my hand<br>
			And I&rsquo;m just trying to get back to normal<br>
			Not too stiff, too formal<br>
			What do I do with my hands?<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Now I&rsquo;m drifting through our regular store<br>
			Pretending I&rsquo;m not wishing you behind every door<br>
			And I can&rsquo;t remember what my words were good for<br>
			Now I don&rsquo;t get to say I love you anymore<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I&rsquo;m swimming back to shore<br>
			Just trying to keep your<br>
			Memory from washing over me<br>
			And oh, I&rsquo;m sure. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Tessa-violet-i-dont-get-to-say-i-love-you-anymore-lyrics">more</a>
