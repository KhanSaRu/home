		[Verse 1]
You said that you love me, but you told a lie
Outside you&rsquo;re lovely, but I&rsquo;ve seen inside
And all of your friends told me, time wasn&rsquo;t right

[Pre-Chorus]
You go too slow, you stay so cold
I speak my mind, you still say no

[Chorus]
It&rsquo;s blurry nights that haunt my mind
Don&rsquo;t wanna find out, might just cry
I might have tied myself up high
And just let go, I&rsquo;ll touch the sky for you
It&rsquo;s blurry nights I can&rsquo;t get through
You told me lies I thought were true
But I&rsquo;ll get over you. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-blurry-nights-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]
Sorry, please excuse me for the mess
I promise it&rsquo;s a temporary issue
I&rsquo;m tired, let me lay down on your chest
We can go to CVS together, looking for some tissues
I just wanna wake up every morning and just fall back asleep
I&rsquo;m on a phone call with Roald Dahl, we&rsquo;re friends in my dream
I get the sore jaw treatment from when I grit my teeth
I feel my stress overwhelming me until I&rsquo;m deadbeat, oh

[Chorus]
I can&rsquo;t say no
I can&rsquo;t say no to you
I can&rsquo;t say no
I can&rsquo;t say no, it&rsquo;s true

[Verse 2]
When I feel like a pain, like a burden, go
Take another day &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s hurtin&rsquo;, oh
I feel you close. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-letter-for-my-bed-lyrics">more</a>

		<h1 id = "R9">Route 9 </h1>
		<p>
		[Refrain]
Funny that I fall apart
When I streamline route 9 with my car, I scream
Insomnia won&rsquo;t keep me up
But when morning comes I&rsquo;m almost out of steam
I hold on to all my vices while my head is in a crisis
I hurt my feet, and I dot my T&rsquo;s
And I clean my room like twice a year
When I&rsquo;m breaking down
I&rsquo;m a sex machine in my dreams

[Chorus]
Ooh, please, don&rsquo;t ever leave
I said please, don&rsquo;t ever leave
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Please, don&rsquo;t. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-route-9-lyrics">more</a>

		[Intro]
([?], it&rsquo;s not stained, well, it looks stain
What&rsquo;s with all the clothes on the ground
Don&rsquo;t you have like a, don&rsquo;t you have drawers?
Jesus, how much clothes do you have?)

[Chorus]
I&rsquo;m lost, I&rsquo;m launched and displaced
A disgrace shot out of orbit floating into outer space
I&rsquo;m amazed, I guess it&rsquo;s me who won the race
I&rsquo;m left with 18 years of life, I still don&rsquo;t know my name
Notice that I walk with inhibition feeling upside down
It&rsquo;s blurry in my visions, are you happy?
You don&rsquo;t gotta lie and try to say that you&rsquo;re my safest sound
You&rsquo;d hurry up to find out, I&rsquo;m unhappy
I just wanna be around

[Verse]
Why do I deserve to die?
Doesn&rsquo;t everybody lie. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-lost-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]
I don&rsquo;t wanna go alone into my bed
Can you let me use your shoulder for my head?
And you don&rsquo;t have to be outside
&rsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t mind, I got room
And I got time for you instead of being so cold

[Chorus]
You could stay
And we could binge watch movies night and day
I don&rsquo;t want you to be 2.9 miles away (Aww)

[Verse 2]
Whenever I see you I feel like
Another deer or a caribou caught in headlights
Losing my focus on my own but it&rsquo;s alright
&rsquo;Cause I can see us dancing in the moonlight
Oh, I get so cold without you
About to let you know that

Where do we go in the middle of June?
Night is over, I mean, what can I do?
These days I&rsquo;m fallin&rsquo;
These days I&rsquo;m fallin&rsquo; over you
Where do we go in the middle of June?

[Bridge]
Woah, I won&rsquo;t let you go
No, no, no, no
I said, woah, I won&rsquo;t let you go, go, go

[Chorus]
We&rsquo;ll be sipping lemonade, we&rsquo;ll be fine
Don&rsquo;t worry about the time
We&rsquo;re falling outta place, but I don&rsquo;t mind
Feeling really cold in the midst of July
&rsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re not by my side
I&rsquo;ve been a mess, but I. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-i-wont-let-you-go-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
		[Verse 1]
I wonder why I feel I’m on top of the moon
Oh, wait, it’s &rsquo;cause of you
I fill my cup with apple juice
Sunday morning watching cartoons
Baby, I don’t wanna go home tonight
Let me stay with you, it’s 4 am, and your dads come in

[Chorus]
&rsquo;Cause I don’t get spooked easily
Looked on tv, I swear I saw your eyes
I was watching documentaries
Of stars and Mars and planets in the sky

[Verse 2]
Have you ever wondered like I do?
And had those sleepless nights, it’s when I think of you
Have you ever wondered like I do?

		[Verse 1]
I wish I was in your class
I only see you in the halls
I wish I could hold your hand and pull you close
But we don&rsquo;t even talk at all
At all, at all, at all
I don&rsquo;t wanna be that guy
I&rsquo;m kind of shy
I mean, I don&rsquo;t feel like just saying "Hi"
And I don&rsquo;t wanna be alone
I just wanna be at home
Next to you with my tunes

[Chorus]
I wish I could call you, baby
But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s happening now
Feeling like a lost cause since the beginning
And it just don&rsquo;t want to be found
I don&rsquo;t wanna try too hard to be different
And I don&rsquo;t wanna. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-i-wish-lyrics">more</a>

		[Verse 1]
We kissed under the stars so far away
We could see Mars
I felt like maybe it was now I had a purpose
You held me close, said it was cold
I said I know, I told you I was nervous
And you will always be
So flawed and imperfect
But I can only see your eyes

[Chorus]
Lovely like a fire in the sky, I don&rsquo;t care
Your eyes are like a jar of fireflies, summer air
I&rsquo;d like to hold your hand while I see you smile
Lovely that I get to hold it for a while
Lovely like a fire in the sky, I don&rsquo;t care
Your еyes are like a jar of firеflies, summer air
I&rsquo;d like to hold your. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-lovely-lyrics">more</a>

Surely, I got nowhere to go

Woah, I don’t want to go

Take away what I’ve got
So I don’t lose my crown

		[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I recall a time when all I did was sit and swim
I was lost in my head, and I wouldn’t let you in
But we were never hungry and never in despair
And I was always nice &rsquo;til I dragged you up the stairs by your hair

[Refrain]
I’m zoning out, I’m zoning out
Woah, yeah
I’m zoning
One, two, three, four

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t wanna talk about it
I got plenty of reason to be in awe off topic
But I’ve been on the road for far too long (Far too long)

Baby, I don’t want to say
I want you to be ok
My ceiling’s coming down to play with my head
Oh, but they can’t get me in my bed (Aww)
Where do I go when it gets cold?
Colder than the moon
They wanna live before they get old
But I’m not sure I want to

Waste me, waste myself, disillusioned

I’m by the fireworks, they set up at the pond
I see your tires work, I hiccup when your gone
I get admirers, I set up with the con
I’m a retired clerk, I’m fed up with the song
