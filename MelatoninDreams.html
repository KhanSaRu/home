			[Verse 1]<br>
			You said that you love me, but you told a lie<br>
			Outside you&rsquo;re lovely, but I&rsquo;ve seen inside<br>
			And all of your friends told me, time wasn&rsquo;t right<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			You go too slow, you stay so cold<br>
			I speak my mind, you still say no<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			It&rsquo;s blurry nights that haunt my mind<br>
			Don&rsquo;t wanna find out, might just cry<br>
			I might have tied myself up high<br>
			And just let go, I&rsquo;ll touch the sky for you<br>
			It&rsquo;s blurry nights I can&rsquo;t get through<br>
			You told me lies I thought were true<br>
			But I&rsquo;ll get over you. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-blurry-nights-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Sorry, please excuse me for the mess<br>
			I promise it&rsquo;s a temporary issue<br>
			I&rsquo;m tired, let me lay down on your chest<br>
			We can go to CVS together, looking for some tissues<br>
			I just wanna wake up every morning and just fall back asleep<br>
			I&rsquo;m on a phone call with Roald Dahl, we&rsquo;re friends in my dream<br>
			I get the sore jaw treatment from when I grit my teeth<br>
			I feel my stress overwhelming me until I&rsquo;m deadbeat, oh<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I can&rsquo;t say no<br>
			I can&rsquo;t say no to you<br>
			I can&rsquo;t say no<br>
			I can&rsquo;t say no, it&rsquo;s true<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			When I feel like a pain, like a burden, go<br>
			Take another day &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s hurtin&rsquo;, oh<br>
			I feel you close. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-letter-for-my-bed-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Refrain]<br>
			Funny that I fall apart<br>
			When I streamline route 9 with my car, I scream<br>
			Insomnia won&rsquo;t keep me up<br>
			But when morning comes I&rsquo;m almost out of steam<br>
			I hold on to all my vices while my head is in a crisis<br>
			I hurt my feet, and I dot my T&rsquo;s<br>
			And I clean my room like twice a year<br>
			When I&rsquo;m breaking down<br>
			I&rsquo;m a sex machine in my dreams<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Ooh, please, don&rsquo;t ever leave<br>
			I said please, don&rsquo;t ever leave<br>

			([?], it&rsquo;s not stained, well, it looks stain<br>
			What&rsquo;s with all the clothes on the ground<br>
			Don&rsquo;t you have like a, don&rsquo;t you have drawers?<br>
			Jesus, how much clothes do you have?)<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I&rsquo;m lost, I&rsquo;m launched and displaced<br>
			A disgrace shot out of orbit floating into outer space<br>
			I&rsquo;m amazed, I guess it&rsquo;s me who won the race<br>
			I&rsquo;m left with 18 years of life, I still don&rsquo;t know my name<br>
			Notice that I walk with inhibition feeling upside down<br>
			It&rsquo;s blurry in my visions, are you happy?<br>
			You don&rsquo;t gotta lie and try to say that you&rsquo;re my safest sound<br>
			You&rsquo;d hurry up to find out, I&rsquo;m unhappy<br>
			I just wanna be around<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I don&rsquo;t wanna go alone into my bed<br>
			Can you let me use your shoulder for my head?<br>
			And you don&rsquo;t have to be outside<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t mind, I got room<br>
			And I got time for you instead of being so cold<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			You could stay<br>
			And we could binge watch movies night and day<br>
			I don&rsquo;t want you to be 2.9 miles away (Aww)<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Whenever I see you I feel like<br>
			Another deer or a caribou caught in headlights<br>
			Losing my focus on my own but it&rsquo;s alright<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I can see us dancing in the moonlight<br>
			Oh, I get so cold without you<br>

			Where do we go in the middle of June?<br>
			Night is over, I mean, what can I do?<br>

			These days I&rsquo;m fallin&rsquo; over you<br>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I wonder why I feel I’m on top of the moon<br>
			Oh, wait, it’s &rsquo;cause of you<br>
			I fill my cup with apple juice<br>
			Sunday morning watching cartoons<br>
			Baby, I don’t wanna go home tonight<br>
			Let me stay with you, it’s 4 am, and your dads come in<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I don’t get spooked easily<br>
			Looked on tv, I swear I saw your eyes<br>
			I was watching documentaries<br>
			Of stars and Mars and planets in the sky<br>

			I wish I was in your class<br>
			I only see you in the halls<br>
			I wish I could hold your hand and pull you close<br>
			But we don&rsquo;t even talk at all<br>
			At all, at all, at all<br>
			I don&rsquo;t wanna be that guy<br>
			I&rsquo;m kind of shy<br>

			We kissed under the stars so far away<br>
			We could see Mars<br>
			I felt like maybe it was now I had a purpose<br>
			You held me close, said it was cold<br>
			I said I know, I told you I was nervous<br>
			And you will always be<br>
			So flawed and imperfect<br>
			But I can only see your eyes<br>

			Lovely like a fire in the sky, I don&rsquo;t care<br>
			Your eyes are like a jar of fireflies, summer air<br>
			I&rsquo;d like to hold your hand while I see you smile<br>

			I recall a time when all I did was sit and swim<br>
			I was lost in my head, and I wouldn’t let you in<br>
			But we were never hungry and never in despair<br>
			And I was always nice &rsquo;til I dragged you up the stairs by your hair<br>
