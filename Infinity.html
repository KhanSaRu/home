			[Verse 1: Jack]<br>
			Was it all in my head?<br>
			In an empty bed<br>
			And I told you that I need you<br>
			Baby, can't you see I'm alone?<br>
			Oh, oh<br>
			I was lost in my feet<br>
			On an empty street<br>
			So I save your seat, infinity<br>
			Forever figures 5 and 3<br>
			You know, oh oh<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus 1: Ryan]<br>
			Cross my heart and hope to die<br>
			Stick a needle in my eye<br>
			My mama says to pick the best<br>
			And you are it<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Jack]<br>
			Hey!<br>
			All our trouble's gone<br>

			<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Wasted, wasted love<br>
			You had so much to give for giving every time<br>
			Darlin', had enough<br>
			And now I understand, so put your hands in mine<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Baby, I will take you far away<br>
			Don't you know these are our golden days?<br>
			Baby, all the other boys - they don't see what I see<br>
			Now, won't you say you see it in me?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Oh, tambourines and skinny jeans<br>
			Oh, won't you be my summer love?<br>
			Take you walking through the garden<br>
			Take my heart. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-alice-by-the-hudson-lyrics">more</a>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			I didn't know her, couldn't hold her<br>
			Bones didn't settle in<br>
			She's gotta have it, gotta have it<br>
			Oh, with her hipster friends<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Oh oh, she's the rough and the rowdiest kid<br>
			Oh oh, and there's more where she lives<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And why should I spend time running for my life?<br>
			And when the skies are open, we'll still be singing this<br>
			I know they're coming for me, we're not the pitchfork kids<br>
			Oh oh, it's the loneliest life that we live<br>
			Oh oh, we're not running. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Ajr-pitchfork-kids-lyrics">more</a>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			The coldest train car<br>
			3 o'clock at dawn<br>
			Remember alcohol and dancing<br>
			Our friends are gone now<br>
			Cause she chose me to take her home<br>
			I guess that's all I've ever wanted<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I just can't believe<br>
			That you chose a guy like me<br>
			No matter where you go<br>
			I will go down that road<br>
			The one that takes you home<br>
			After the party's done<br>

			[Hook]<br>
			And all is well<br>

			[Intro]<br>
			Are you ready<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			You're feeling good, you're feeling right<br>
			Across the floor, and I'm already losing my mind<br>
			Baby girl, looking fine<br>
			Watch you playing and playing and playing these guys<br>
			Catch my stare, little smile<br>
			Tell me that you're ready and you're feeling the vibe<br>
			Someday I'll be so damn sublime<br>
			We'll arrive behind a hash-tag sign<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I won't forget you, but I may<br>
			Forget your name<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I know what you're thinking<br>
