			[Verse 1]<br>
			I just wanna be an all-star, run five hundred yards<br>
			Rockstar life, buying luxury cars<br>
			I want a Bentley, want a nice Porsche<br>
			I want a whip with butterfly doors<br>
			Grammy and a billion views<br>
			Enough money to afford nice shoes<br>
			Girlfriends and a Golden Goose and a golden tooth<br>
			Man, what about you?<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I just wanna go back to my room<br>
			I don&rsquo;t want the fame, I just want you<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			I wish I was famous, nobody knows me<br>
			I do the same shit, do what they tell me<br>
			I had dreams that. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-rockstar-lyrics">more</a>

			[Intro]<br>
			Ahh, oh, no, no, no, no, ooh, oh<br>
			Ahh, no, no, no, no<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Half of my heart wants what we had again (Oh, ahh)<br>
			Falling apart thinkin&rsquo;, &ldquo;What could&rsquo;ve been?&rdquo;<br>
			Don&rsquo;t make it harder than it has to be<br>
			Baby, please, I don&rsquo;t think we can be friends<br>
			(Can be friends, we can, we can)<br>
			Half of my heart wants what we had again (We can, we can)<br>
			Falling apart thinkin&rsquo;, &ldquo;What could&rsquo;ve been?&rdquo; (Ahh, oh, oh)<br>
			Don&rsquo;t make it harder than it has to be<br>
			Baby, please, I don&rsquo;t think we can be friends<br>
			(Can be friends, we can, we can)<br>
			<br>
			[Verse]<br>
			I just wanna stop, had enough, out of love and out of luck<br>
			I don&rsquo;t wanna give. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-idtwcbf-friends-lyrics">more</a>

			[Chorus]<br>
			We&rsquo;re all grown up, we&rsquo;re all so lost<br>
			Nothing has prepped us for this life<br><!-- I used the line break element to differentiate between
													each line of the song. It also helps creat stanzas -->
			It&rsquo;s like we don&rsquo;t know why<br>
			Nosediving from the high<br>
			We&rsquo;re all grown up, we&rsquo;re all so lost<br>
			Nothing has prepped us for this life<br>
			It&rsquo;s like we don&rsquo;t know why<br>
			Nosediving from the high<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I won&rsquo;t let the memories fade<br>
			Hazel eyes and summer shades<br>
			Hair on fire, hand grenades<br>
			I won&rsquo;t get up out my bed<br>
			I can&rsquo;t get you out my head<br>
			I hope I don&rsquo;t. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-nosedive-lyrics">more</a>
