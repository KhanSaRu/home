		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I&rsquo;m like the water when your ship rolled in that night<br>
			Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife<br>
			And if it was an open-shut case<br>
			I never would&rsquo;ve known from that look on your face<br>
			Lost in your current like a priceless winev
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			The more that you say, the less I know<br>
			Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
			I&rsquo;m begging for you to take my hand<br>
			Wreck my plans, that&rsquo;s my man<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind<br>
			Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin&rsquo; in<br>
			As if you were a mythical thing<br>
			Like you were a trophy. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-willow-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "CP">Champagne Problems </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			You booked the night train for a reason<br>
			So you could sit there in this hurt<br>
			Bustling crowds or silent sleepers<br>
			You&rsquo;re not sure which is worse<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Because I dropped your hand while dancing<br>
			Left you out there standing<br>
			Crestfallen on the landing<br>
			Champagne problems<br>
			Your mom&rsquo;s ring in your pocket<br>
			My picture in your wallet<br>
			Your heart was glass, I dropped it<br>
			Champagne. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-champagne-problems-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "GR">Gold Rush </h2>
		<p>
			[Intro]<br>
			Gleaming, twinkling<br>
			Eyes like sinking ships on waters<br>
			So inviting, I almost jump in<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			But I don&rsquo;t like a gold rush, gold rush<br>
			I don&rsquo;t like anticipatin&rsquo; my face in a red flush<br>
			I don&rsquo;t like that anyone would die to feel your touch<br>
			Everybody wants you<br>
			Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you<br>
			Walk past, quick brush<br>
			I don&rsquo;t like slow motion, double vision in rose blush<br>
			I don&rsquo;t like that falling feels like flying &rsquo;til the bone crush<br>
			Everybody wants you<br>
			But I don&rsquo;t like. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-gold-rush-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "TTDS">&rsquo;Tis The Damn Season </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			If I wanted to know who you were hanging with<br>
			While I was gone, I would&rsquo;ve asked you<br>
			It&rsquo;s the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass<br>
			But I felt it when I passed you<br>
			There&rsquo;s an ache in you, put there by the ache in me<br>
			But if it&rsquo;s all the same to you<br>
			It&rsquo;s the same to me<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			So we could call it even<br>
			You could call me &ldquo;babe&rdquo; for the weekend<br>
			&rsquo;Tis the damn season, write this down<br>
			I&rsquo;m stayin&rsquo; at my parents&rsquo; house<br>
			And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
			And it always. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-tis-the-damn-season-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "TI">Tolerate It </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I sit and watch you reading with your head low<br>
			I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed<br>
			I sit and watch you<br>
			I notice everything you do or don&rsquo;t do<br>
			You&rsquo;re so much older and wiser, and I<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus 1]<br>
			I wait by the door like I&rsquo;m just a kid<br>
			Use my best colors for your portrait<br>
			Lay the table with the fancy shit<br>
			And watch you tolerate it<br>
			If it&rsquo;s all in my head, tell me now<br>
			Tell me I&rsquo;ve got it wrong somehow<br>
			I know my love should be celebrated<br>
			But you tolerate. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-tolerate-it-lyrics">more</a>

			[Intro: HAIM]<br>
			He did it<br>
			He did it<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]<br>
			Este&rsquo;s a friend of mine<br>
			We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine<br>
			Este&rsquo;s been losin&rsquo; sleep<br>
			Her husband&rsquo;s actin&rsquo; different, and it smells like infidelity<br>
			She says, &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t my Merlot on his mouth<br>
			That ain&rsquo;t my jewelry on our joint account&rdquo;<br>
			No, there ain&rsquo;t no doubt<br>
			I think I&rsquo;m gonna call him out<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]<br>
			She says, &ldquo;I think he did it, but I just can&rsquo;t prove it&rdquo;<br>
			I think he did it, but I just can&rsquo;t prove it<br>

		<h2 id = "H">Happiness </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Honey, when I&rsquo;m above the trees<br>
			I see this for what it is<br>
			But now I&rsquo;m right down in it, all the years I&rsquo;ve given<br>
			Is just shit we&rsquo;re dividin&rsquo; up<br>
			Showed you all of my hiding spots<br>
			I was dancing when the music stopped<br>
			And in the disbelief, I can&rsquo;t face reinvention<br>
			I haven&rsquo;t met the new me yet<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			There&rsquo;ll be happiness after you<br>
			But there was happiness because of you<br>
			Both of these things can be true<br>
			There is happiness<br>

		<h2 id = "D">Dorothea </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?<br>
			When we were younger, down in the park<br>
			Honey, makin&rsquo; a lark of the misery<br>
			You got shiny friends since you left town<br>
			A tiny screen&rsquo;s the only place I see you now<br>
			And I got nothin&rsquo; but well wishes for ya<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Ooh<br>
			This place is the same as it ever was<br>
			Ooh<br>
			But you won&rsquo;t like it that way<br>

		<h2 id = "CI">Coney Island </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]<br>
			Break my soul in two looking for you<br>
			But you&rsquo;re right here<br>
			If I can&rsquo;t relate to you anymore<br>
			Then who am I related to?<br>
			And if this is the long haul<br>
			How&rsquo;d we get here so soon?<br>
			Did I close my fist around something delicate?<br>
			Did I shatter you?<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]<br>
			And I&rsquo;m sitting on a bench in Coney Island<br>
			Wondering where did my baby go?<br>
			The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go<br>
			Sorry for not. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-coney-island-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "I">Ivy </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			How&rsquo;s one to know?<br>
			I&rsquo;d meet you where the spirit meets the bones<br>
			In a faith-forgotten land<br>
			In from the snow<br>
			Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow<br>
			Tarnished but so grand<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			And the old widow goes to the stone every day<br>
			But I don&rsquo;t, I just sit here and wait<br>
			Grieving for the living<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Oh, goddamn<br>
			My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand<br>
			Taking mine, but it&rsquo;s been promised to another<br>
			Oh, I can&rsquo;t. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-ivy-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "CLM">Cowboy Like Me </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			And the tennis court was covered up<br>
			With some tent-like thing<br>
			And you asked me to dance<br>
			But I said, &ldquo;Dancin&rsquo; is a dangerous game&rdquo;<br>
			Oh, I thought<br>
			This is gonna be one of those things<br>
			Now I know<br>
			I&rsquo;m never gonna love again<br>
			<br>
			[Refrain]<br>
			I&rsquo;ve got some tricks up my sleeve<br>
			Takes one to know one<br>
			You&rsquo;re a cowboy like me<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Never wanted love<br>
			Just a fancy car. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-cowboy-like-me-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "LSS">Long Story Short </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Fatefully<br>
			I tried to pick my battles &rsquo;til the battle picked me<br>
			Misery<br>
			Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep<br>
			And you passed right by<br>
			I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides<br>
			The knife cuts both ways<br>
			If the shoe fits, walk in it &rsquo;til your high heels break<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			And I fell from the pedestal<br>
			Right down the rabbit hole<br>
			Long story short, it was a bad time<br>
			Pushed from the precipice<br>
			Clung to the nearest lips<br>
			Long story short, it was the wrong guy<br>
			<br>
			[Post-Chorus]<br>
			Now I&rsquo;m all about you<br>
			I&rsquo;m all about you. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-long-story-short-lyrics">more</a>

			[Verse 1]<br>
			Never be so kind<br>
			You forget to be clever<br>
			Never be so clever<br>
			You forget to be kind<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			And if I didn&rsquo;t know better<br>
			I&rsquo;d think you were talking to me now<br>
			If I didn&rsquo;t know better<br>
			I&rsquo;d think you were still around<br>
			<br>

			What died didn&rsquo;t stay dead<br>
			What died didn&rsquo;t stay dead<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			It&rsquo;s been a long time<br>
			And seeing the shape of your name<br>
			Still spells out pain<br>
			It wasn&rsquo;t right<br>
			The way it all went down<br>
			Looks like you know that now<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Yes, I got your letter<br>
			Yes, I&rsquo;m doing better<br>
			It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone<br>
			Yes, I got your letter<br>
			Yes, I&rsquo;m doing better<br>
			I know that it&rsquo;s over, I don&rsquo;t need your<br>
			Closure, your closure<br>

		<p>
			[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]<br>
			Gray November<br>
			I&rsquo;ve been down since July<br>
			Motion capture<br>
			Put me in a bad light<br>
			I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone<br>
			Trying to find the one where I went wrong<br>
			Writing letters<br>
			Addressed to the fire<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus: Taylor Swift]<br>
			And I was catching my breath<br>
			Staring out an open window<br>
			Catching my death<br>
			And I couldn&rsquo;t be sure<br>
			I had a feeling so peculiar<br>
			That this pain would be for<br>
