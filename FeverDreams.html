		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Two moons, I can feel myself start catching on fire<br>
			You knew, yeah, you kept it to yourself, to yourself<br>
			Two moons, I get lost on my way searching for liars<br>
			This ain&rsquo;t good for my health, no, this ain&rsquo;t good for my health<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Sorry, please excuse me for my mess<br>
			My heart&rsquo;s been pouring through my chest<br>
			I fell through corridors of broken floors<br>
			I&rsquo;m sorry that I left<br>
			Fell asleep in my new bed<br>
			I can&rsquo;t feel happy in my head<br>
			I see two moons and nothing more<br>
			I close my door, I&rsquo;m left with less<br>
			<br>
			[Post-Chorus]<br>
			Ooooh, Oooooh<br>

		<h2 id = "P">Psycho </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Tobi tells me lies when I&rsquo;m sleep-deprived<br>
			Tobi says that I&rsquo;m the worst of my kind<br>
			The voice that trails behind makes me petrified<br>
			Thinking I won&rsquo;t live to see twenty-five<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			They tell me I should go, go, go, go<br>
			They say I have no home, no home<br>
			They tell me I should go, go, go, go<br>
			They tell me I&rsquo;m a psycho, psycho<br>
			<br>
			[Bridge]<br>
			(Sweatshirt&rsquo;s dirty, my friends hurt me<br>
			My girlfriend is flirting with another dude<br>

		<h2 id = "OOT">Out Of Tune </h2>
		<p>
			[Chorus]<br>
			No matter what I do<br>
			I can&rsquo;t love because of you<br>
			You fucked me up and put me out of tune<br>
			I do my best to fake that I&rsquo;m good<br>
			But I forget my place too soon<br>
			Oh, can&rsquo;t you say goodbye<br>
			To the scars you left behind?<br>
			How &rsquo;bout you get the fuck outta my mind?<br>
			I swear that I can&rsquo;t feel love<br>
			Oh, won&rsquo;t you say goodbye<br>
			To all my butterflies?<br>
			I can&rsquo;t look you in your eyes again<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I began to track dark times with no peach<br>
			Lime smoothies, no time for bus rides with<br>
			Sad rhymes to climb right out of dark times<br>
			I pass the clock by watching you playing Fortnite<br>
			No, for real, that&rsquo;s. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-out-of-tune-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "S">Shy </h2>
		<p>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Hi, hello<br>
			I&rsquo;m quite a shy fellow<br>
			Yo no recuerdo palabras cuando estoy contigo<br>
			And I still don’t know how to let go<br>
			Of feelings that I felt for you, baby<br>
			And my anxiety&rsquo;s pushing limits<br>
			Setting benchmarks higher than the fucking moon<br>
			Sorry, I don&rsquo;t mean to be rude<br>
			<br>
			[Post-Chorus]<br>
			And I’ve been fighting feelings<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I know that I&rsquo;m too shy to make a move<br>
			Looking up tutorials on YouTube<br>
			<br>
			[Instrumental]<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Stay inside<br>
			I&rsquo;ll be home. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-shy-lyrics">more</a>

		<p>
			[Refrain]<br>
			Can&rsquo;t get you out my gaze, and<br>
			Can&rsquo;t feel my legs when you&rsquo;re around<br>
			I feel so lost, I feel so found<br>
			You&rsquo;re poison to my thoughts, but<br>
			You look amazing in your gown<br>
			I&rsquo;m feeling great, I&rsquo;m feeling down<br>
			‎<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Wishing I could see how you could end up in my arms<br>
			I know that you&rsquo;re not perfect for me, but you&rsquo;ve caught my heart<br>
			I&rsquo;ll sail the seas, sing the ABC&rsquo;s in the war to win you over<br>
			I swear you had me right from the start<br>
			Let&rsquo;s build a fort out of pillows while we look at the stars<br>
			I&rsquo;ll bring a portable charger and we&rsquo;ll dance in the dark<br>
			Am I insane for thinking forward to a time so far?<br>
			It makes me feel. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-hazel-eyes-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "HH">Haha, Hi </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I think we talked about a TV show that you liked<br>
			Something I forget &rsquo;cause I was thinking, &ldquo;Whoa, are her eyes real?&rdquo;<br>
			Ain&rsquo;t no way she gon&rsquo; be feeling what I feel<br>
			But I guess I&rsquo;m not a psychic, &rsquo;cause she&rsquo;s sitting in my automobile right now<br>
			Singing as I stir my wheel, oh dear<br>
			Like how? It&rsquo;s been well over a year<br>
			I don&rsquo;t believe it when she says she misses me or when she kisses me<br>
			There must be an alternative motive I miss<br>
			So help me, please, to understand<br>
			How and why you stuck around<br>
			It&rsquo;s like you hopped the fence and said nobody is allowed back here<br>
			I disregarded all of my fears<br>
			And I remember when we first spoke words, I&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m her&rdquo;"<br>

			[Intro]<br>
			(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I don&rsquo;t wanna take out loans, I don&rsquo;t wanna be at home<br>
			I don&rsquo;t wanna say goodbye and I don&rsquo;t wanna be alone<br>
			I just wanna stay inside, I don&rsquo;t know how or where I&rsquo;d hide<br>
			And I don&rsquo;t wanna suicide, but I&rsquo;m getting sick of life<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			I wake up every morning feeling like a sack of shit<br>
			And it don&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s pouring outside<br>
			&rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m so sick of all the fallacies and galaxies I make with all the sticks I find<br>
			And words that rhyme, I try to cry, I tried to mind my pessimist<br>
			But consciousness is closing in, and my resolve is wearing thin<br>
			Impulsiveness is my illness and demons like to listen in<br>
			I&rsquo;m falling through the. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-kind-of-sick-of-life-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "BL">Bad Luck </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			I got twenty-four minutes to finish all of my sentences<br>
			To be dependent to medicine while I saw you running away<br>
			I said okay to myself<br>
			It&rsquo;d be better for health if I turn around and look the other way<br>
			But my brain is a silicone mimic of a dome<br>
			And I say that I hate you, but I really don&rsquo;t<br>
			You fill my head with ideas, oh, baby<br>
			I can&rsquo;t stay away<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Ooh, baby, you stole my heart with your jumper<br>
			Kangaroos wearing shoes trying to run from the hunters<br>
			I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;ve been dealing with all of my shit<br>
			I hope I get to stay here with you, I&rsquo;ll take you on a trip<br>
			<br>

		<h2 id = "SD">Sleep Deprived </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Is it wrong that I still like you, baby?<br>
			Is it wrong that I write you songs?<br>
			Am I wrong for holding on to my feelings?<br>
			That I&rsquo;ve felt for, oh, so long<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Maybe I should go to sleep<br>
			Been thinking that I might be over my head in too deep<br>
			I&rsquo;m having fever dreams in my bed while I count my sheep<br>
			I become deprived of my sleep and mental health is weak<br>
			I think, I think<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			It gets tough when I see your face light up<br>
			Like a candle when you look in his eyes<br>
			I hope that you could see my silence<br>
			Pray for God I stay. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-sleep-deprived-lyrics">more</a>

		<h2 id = "FM">Forget Me </h2>
		<p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Too slow for the left lane, too fast for the right train<br>
			I&rsquo;m still kicking up dust, I&rsquo;ve been eating all Friday<br>
			Got my plans, hey, fuck it, man, I&rsquo;ma have it my way<br>
			It&rsquo;s okay &rsquo;til I hurt myself<br>
			It&rsquo;s a fucked up world of abysmal health<br>
			And I don&rsquo;t wanna be without a bit of hate in my belt<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			All I want is to break your heart<br>
			Oh, I thought that I could go<br>
			Oh, baby, you can&rsquo;t save me<br>
			I belong on the roads you left me on<br>
			I write my pains<br>
			Oh, baby, you can&rsquo;t save me<br>

			You came. . .<a href = "https://genius.com/Boywithuke-forget-me-lyrics">more</a>

			[Chorus]<br>
			Oh, I&rsquo;m just a lost boy, I&rsquo;m suffering<br>
			I&rsquo;m stuck with the Bok Choy and I miss my friends<br>
			Where do we go babe? Where is my home?<br>
			Oh, I&rsquo;m just a lost toy, I lost my soul<br>
			I said I Iost my soul<br>
			Does someone know where I go?<br>
			Oh, I can feel that I&rsquo;m close<br>
